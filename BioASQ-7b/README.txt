Since we are uploading our internal data used for the Challenge, please be noticed that the test data for 7b batch 1 may be processed with a bit different (corse) pre-processing method. 
We are investigating the dataset now to solve this inconsistency in pre-processing methods. 
For the same reason, 7b-1 test data files with the snippet method are missing. 

If you still see this message after the official release of BioASQ-BioBERT repository, please contact Wonjin Yoon (the first author).
Thanks
