          "context": "Myasthenia gravis: the role of complement at the neuromuscular junction. Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by skeletal muscle weakness caused by disrupted neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Approximately 74-88% of patients with gMG have acetylcholine receptor (AChR) autoantibodies. Complement plays an important role in innate and antibody-mediated immunity, and activation and amplification of complement results in the formation of membrane attack complexes (MACs), lipophilic proteins that damage cell membranes. The role of complement in gMG has been demonstrated in animal models and patients. Studies in animals lacking specific complement proteins have confirmed that MAC formation is required to induce experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG) and NMJ damage. Complement inhibition in EAMG models can prevent disease induction and reverse its progression. Patients with anti-AChR MG have autoantibodies and MACs present at NMJs. Damaged NMJs are associated with more severe disease, fewer AChRs, and MACs in synaptic debris. Current MG therapies do not target complement directly. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits cleavage of complement protein C5, preventing MAC formation. Eculizumab treatment improved symptoms compared with placebo in a phase II study in patients with refractory gMG. Direct complement inhibition could preserve NMJ physiology and muscle function in patients with anti-AChR gMG.",

The humanized monoclonal antibody eculizumab (Soliris) is a complement inhibitor indicated for use in anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in the USA, refractory gMG in the EU, or gMG with symptoms that are difficult to control with high-dose IVIg therapy or PLEX in Japan. It is the first complement inhibitor to be approved for use in these patients. In the well-designed, 26-week REGAIN study in patients with anti-AChR-positive refractory gMG, although a statistically significant benefit of eculizumab over placebo in the prespecified primary endpoint analysis (change from baseline in MG-activities of daily living (ADL)\u00a0score assessed by worst-rank ANCOVA) was not formally demonstrated, preplanned and post hoc sensitivity analyses of this outcome, as well as other secondary outcomes supported the efficacy of eculizumab. Overall, patients receiving eculizumab experienced significant improvements in the ADL, muscle strength and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) parameters relative to patients receiving placebo. Moreover, an ongoing extension of REGAIN showed that treatment benefits with eculizumab were sustained during continued therapy for at least 52\u00a0weeks. Eculizumab was generally well tolerated in these studies, with a tolerability profile similar to that reported previously in other indications. Although several questions remain, such as duration of treatment, cost effectiveness and long-term efficacy and tolerability, current evidence indicates that eculizumab is a valuable emerging therapy for patients with refractory gMG.",

BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading chronic hepatic condition worldwide and new approaches to management and treatment are limited. SUMMARY: L-ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA) has hepatoprotective properties in patients with fatty liver of diverse etiology and results of a multicenter randomized clinical trial reveal that 12 weeks treatment with oral LOLA (6-9 g/d) results in a dose-related reduction in activities of liver enzymes and triglycerides together with significant improvements of liver/spleen CT ratios. A preliminary report described improvements of hepatic microcirculation in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) following treatment with LOLA. Mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of LOLA in NAFLD/NASH involve, in addition to its established ammonia-lowering effect, metabolic transformations of the LOLA-constituent amino acids L-ornithine and L-aspartate into L-glutamine, L-arginine, and glutathione. These metabolites have well-established actions implicated in the prevention of lipid peroxidation, improvement of hepatic microcirculation in addition to anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. Key Messages: (1) LOLA is effective for the treatment of key indices in NAFLD/NASH. (2) Mechanisms other than LOLA's ammonia-lowering action have been postulated.

The recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages via chemokine receptor CCR2 as well as of lymphocytes and hepatic stellate cells via CCR5 promote the progression of NASH to fibrosis. Areas covered: I summarize preclinical and clinical data on the efficacy and safety of the dual CCR2/CCR5 inhibitor cenicriviroc (CVC, also TBR-652 or TAK-652) for the treatment of NASH and fibrosis. In animal models of liver diseases, CVC potently inhibits macrophage accumulation in the liver and ameliorates fibrosis. In a phase 2b clinical trial (CENTAUR) on 289 patients with NASH and fibrosis, CVC consistently demonstrated liver fibrosis improvement after 1\u00a0year of therapy and had an excellent safety profile, leading to the implementation of a phase 3 trial (AURORA). Expert opinion: Preclinical and clinical data support the development of CVC as a safe and potent antifibrotic agent.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most prominent forms of chronic liver disease worldwide, reflecting the epidemic of global obesity. Those with the progressive variant of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are at significantly increased risk of multisystem morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies for NASH. Given the disease burden, there is an important unmet need for pharmacologic treatment options for this patient population. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of NAFLD and NASH are complex and reflected by the myriad of therapies, with different targets, currently under investigation. In broad strokes, drug development has focused on modulation of metabolic pathways, inflammatory cascades, and/or mechanisms impacting fibrosis. Although much progress has been made in enhancing our understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis, development of pharmacologic treatments has been hindered by challenges in clinical trial enrollment and complexities in clinical trial design. The compounds in phase IIa have provided promising results in terms of potential benefits on various aspects of histopathology. Agents in later stages of development have shown fairly modest results in terms of reduction of hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, and there is no approved pharmacotherapy. The efficacy of vitamin E and pioglitazone has been established in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a progressive form of NAFLD. GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitors, which are currently approved for use in diabetes, have shown early efficacy in NASH, and also have beneficial cardiovascular or renal effects. Innovative NASH therapies include four main pathways. The first approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation. Medications in this approach include modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (e.g., pemafibrate, elafibranor), medications targeting farnesoid X receptor axis [obeticholic acid; OCA)], inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, ACC inhibitor), and fibroblast growth factor-21 analogues. A second target is oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This class of drug includes apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor and emricasan (an irreversible caspase inhibitor). A third target is intestinal microbiomes and metabolic endotoxemia. Several agents are in ongoing trials, including IMMe124, TLR4 antagonist, and solithromycin (macrolide antibiotics). The final target is hepatic fibrosis, which is strongly associated with all-cause or liver-related mortality in NASH. Antifibrotic agents are a cysteine-cysteine motif chemokine receptor-2/5 antagonist (cenicriviroc; CVC) and galectin 3 antagonist. Among a variety of medications in development, four agents such as OCA, elafibranor, ASK1 inhibitor, and CVC are currently being evaluated in an international phase 3 trial for the treatment of NASH.

We aimed to assess the activity and safety of pazopanib in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. METHODS: In this non-randomised, single-centre, open-label, phase 2 trial, adult patients with clinical manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease were recruited from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) and were treated with pazopanib (800 mg orally daily) for 24 weeks, with an option to continue treatment if desired by the patient and treating physician. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response and safety in the per-protocol population. The objective response was measured for each patient and each lesion type. Radiographic assessments were done at baseline and every 12 weeks throughout the study. Activity and safety were assessed with continuous monitoring and a Bayesian design. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01436227, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2012, and Aug 10, 2016, we screened 37 patients with genetically confirmed or clinical features consistent with von Hippel-Lindau disease, of whom 31 eligible patients were treated with pazopanib. The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 42% (13 of 31 patients). By lesion sites responses were observed in 31 (52%) of 59 renal cell carcinomas, nine (53%) of 17 pancreatic lesions, and two (4%) of 49 CNS haemangioblastomas. Seven (23%) of 31 patients chose to stay on the treatment after 24 weeks. Four (13%) of 31 patients withdrew from the study because of grade 3 or 4 transaminitis, and three (10%) discontinued study treatment because of treatment intolerance with multiple intercurrent grade 1-2 toxicities. Treatment-related serious adverse events included one case each of appendicitis and gastritis and one patient had a fatal CNS bleed. INTERPRETATION: Pazopanib was associated with encouraging preliminary activity in von Hippel-Lindau disease, with a side-effect profile consistent with that seen in previous trials. Pazopanib could be considered as a treatment choice for patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease and growing lesions, or to reduce the size of unresectable lesions in these patients.

Netrin-1 is a secreted protein that directs long-range axon guidance during early stages of neural circuit formation and continues to be expressed in the mammalian forebrain during the postnatal period of peak synapse formation. Here we demonstrate a synaptogenic function of netrin-1 in rat and mouse cortical neurons and investigate the underlying mechanism. We report that netrin-1 and its receptor DCC are widely expressed by neurons in the developing mammalian cortex during synapse formation and are enriched at synapses in vivo. We detect DCC protein distributed along the axons and dendrites of cultured cortical neurons and provide evidence that newly translated netrin-1 is selectively transported to dendrites. Using gain and loss of function manipulations, we demonstrate that netrin-1 increases the number and strength of excitatory synapses made between developing cortical neurons. We show that netrin-1 increases the complexity of axon and dendrite arbors, thereby increasing the probability of contact. At sites of contact, netrin-1 promotes adhesion, while locally enriching and reorganizing the underlying actin cytoskeleton through Src family kinase signaling and m-Tor-dependent protein translation to locally cluster presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. Finally, we demonstrate using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology that netrin-1 increases the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs recorded from cortical pyramidal neurons.

Cellular stress induced a large increase in netrin-1 production without increase in transcription of netrin-1 gene.

METHODS: Isolation of translational complexes, determination of RNA secondary structures by selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension/dimethyl sulfate, bicistronic constructs, as well as conventional cell biology and biochemistry approaches\u00a0were used on in\u00a0vitro-grown hepatocytic cells, wild-type, and netrin-1 transgenic mice. RESULTS: HepaRG cells constitute a bona fide model for UPR studies in\u00a0vitro through adequate activation of the 3 sensors of the UPR (protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)), inositol requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1), and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6). The netrin-1 messenger RNA 5'-end was shown to fold into a complex double pseudoknot and bear E-loop motifs, both of which are representative hallmarks of related internal ribosome entry site regions. Cap-independent translation of netrin 5' untranslated region-driven luciferase was observed on UPR in\u00a0vitro. Unlike several structurally related oncogenic transcripts (l-myc, c-myc, c-myb), netrin-1 messenger RNA was selected for translation during UPR both in human hepatocytes and in mice livers. Depletion of netrin-1 during UPR induces apoptosis, leading to cell death through an uncoordinated phenotype-5A/C-mediated involvement of protein phosphatase 2A and death-associated protein kinase 1 in\u00a0vitro and in netrin transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: UPR-resistant, internal ribosome entry site-driven\u00a0netrin-1 translation leads to the inhibition of uncoordinated phenotype-5/death-associated protein kinase 1-mediated apoptosis in the hepatic context during UPR, a hallmark of chronic liver disease.",

Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcription coactivator, is the major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, which plays a critical role in organ size control and cancer development. However, how YAP is regulated by extracellular stimuli in tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. Netrin-1, a laminin-related secreted protein, displays proto-oncogenic activity in cancers. Nonetheless, the downstream signaling mediating its oncogenic effects is not well defined. Here we show that netrin-1 via its transmembrane receptors, deleted in colorectal cancer and uncoordinated-5 homolog, up-regulates YAP expression, escalating YAP levels in the nucleus and promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration. Inactivating netrin-1, deleted in colorectal cancer, or uncoordinated-5 homolog B (UNC5B) decreases YAP protein levels, abrogating cancer cell progression by netrin-1, whereas knockdown of mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) or large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (Lats1/2), two sets of upstream core kinases of the Hippo pathway, has no effect in blocking netrin-1-induced up-regulation of YAP. Netrin-1 stimulates phosphatase 1A to dephosphorylate YAP, which leads to decreased ubiquitination and degradation, enhancing YAP accumulation and signaling. Hence, our findings support that netrin-1 exerts oncogenic activity through YAP signaling, providing a mechanism coupling extracellular signals to the nuclear YAP oncogene.",

Netrins are a family of secreted protein related to laminin and act as tropic cues directing axon growth and cell migration during neural development. Netrin-4 is a novel member of netrin family recently identified in the vertebrate with neuritis elongation promoting activity; however, the receptors for netrin-4 are still unknown. To better understand the function and signal transduction pathway of netrin-4, the potential receptors for netrin-4 were studied in this paper. The netrin-4 protein was prepared by introducing a eukaryotic expression vector with a secretable alkaline phosphatase tag (AP4) into COS7 cells to allow the expression of AP4-netrin4 fusion protein. Axon guidance activity of netrin-4 was confirmed by using the cortical explants. After incubation with cultured primary cortical neurons, the neurons were distinctly labeled by the AP4-coupled netrin-4 ligands. In contrast, the binding activity of AP4-netrin4 to neurons could be completely competed by the exogenously expressed netrin-4 protein without AP4 tag, indicating specificity of netrin-4 binding to the potential receptors. Moreover, netrin-4 could also bind to CHO cells transfected with the plasmids expressing two known receptors for netrin-1, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and UNC5 homolog 1 (UNC5H1) respectively. As there are three domains in netrin-4, we further tried to narrow down the region containing binding sites with the receptors. Interestingly, only the N-terminal domain (LNT) could bind to DCC and UNC5H1. A further ligand-receptor binding analysis showed that both the N- and the C-terminal domain (NCT) but not the EGF-like (EGFL) domain of netrin-4 could bind to the surface of cultured primary neurons, indicating the existence of novel receptors for netrin-4. After competed by netrin-4, we confirmed that the binding of AP tagged netrin-4 domains to neurons were also netrin-4 dependent. The binding activity of the N-terminal domain of netrin-4 is about 3-fold higher than that for the C-terminal domain. In summary, our data here indicated that the two known receptors for netrin-1, DCC and UNC5H1, are also receptors for netrin-4, while only LNT but not EGFL and NCT is the key domain for specific binding. In addition, there are novel receptors for netrin-4, where both LNT and NCT but not EGFL are key domains for binding.",

Recent advances in our understanding of the three-dimensional organization of the eukaryotic nucleus have rendered the spatial distribution of genes increasingly relevant. In a recent work (Tsochatzidou et al., Nucleic Acids Res 45:5818-5828, 2017), we proposed the existence of a functional compartmentalization of the yeast genome according to which, genes occupying the chromosomal regions at the nuclear periphery have distinct structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics compared to their centromeric-proximal counterparts. Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing. In this work, we proceed to investigate whether such units of three-dimensional genomic organization can be linked to transcriptional activity as a driving force for the shaping of genomic architecture. Through the application of a simple boundary-calling criterion in genome-wide 3C data, we define ~100 TAD-like domains which can be clustered in six different classes with radically different nucleosomal organizations, significant variations in transcription factor binding and uneven chromosomal distribution. Approximately ~20% of the genome is found to be confined in regions with \"closed\" chromatin structure around gene promoters. Most interestingly, we find both \"open\" and \"closed\" regions to be segregated, in the sense that they tend to avoid inter-chromosomal interactions. Our data further enforce the notion of a marked compartmentalization of the yeast genome in isolated territories, with implications in its function and evolution.",

In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins.",

It has been suggested that A\u03b2 induces changes in neuronal membrane fluidity as a result of its interactions with membrane components such as cholesterol, phospholipids, and gangliosides. Gangliosides are known to bind A\u03b2. A complex of GM1 and A\u03b2, termed \"GA\u03b2\", has been identified in AD brains. Abnormal ganglioside metabolism also may occur in AD brains.

Results of SNP array were analyzed with bioinformatics software. RESULTS: G-banded karyotyping failed to detect any abnormalities in both fetuses and their parents. SNP array detected a 2.484 Mb terminal deletion at 17p13.3 [arr[hg19] 17p13.3 (83 035-2 567 405)\u00d71] in fetus 1 and a 3.295 Mb terminal deletion at 17p13.3p13.2 [arr[hg19] 17p13.3p13.2 (83 035- 3 377 560)\u00d71] in fetus 2.

Chromosome 17p13.3 is a region of genomic instability that is linked to different rare neurodevelopmental genetic diseases, depending on whether a deletion or duplication of the region has occurred. Chromosome microdeletions within 17p13.3 can result in either isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS) or Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS). Both conditions are associated with a smooth cerebral cortex, or lissencephaly, which leads to developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. However, patients with MDS have larger deletions than patients with ILS, resulting in additional symptoms such as poor muscle tone, congenital anomalies, abnormal spasticity, and craniofacial dysmorphisms. In contrast to microdeletions in 17p13.3, recent studies have attracted considerable attention to a condition known as a 17p13.3 microduplication syndrome. Depending on the genes involved in their microduplication, patients with 17p13.3 microduplication syndrome may be categorized into either class I or class II. Individuals in class I have microduplications of the YWHAE gene encoding 14-3-3\u03b5, as well as other genes in the region. However, the PAFAH1B1 gene encoding LIS1 is never duplicated in these patients. Class I microduplications generally result in learning disabilities, autism, and developmental delays, among other disorders. Individuals in class II always have microduplications of the PAFAH1B1 gene, which may include YWHAE and other genetic microduplications. Class II microduplications generally result in smaller body size, developmental delays, microcephaly, and other brain malformations. Here, we review the phenotypes associated with copy number variations (CNVs) of chromosome 17p13.3 and detail their developmental connection to particular microdeletions or microduplications. We also focus on existing single and double knockout mouse models that have been used to study human phenotypes, since the highly limited number of patients makes a study of these conditions difficult in humans. These models are also crucial for the study of brain development at a mechanistic level since this cannot be accomplished in humans.

There are very few reports available, where expressions of sirtuin isoforms are comprehensively analyzed during neoplasia. Therefore, in the present study, the expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT7 during different stages of cervical cancer progression was analyzed. The normal cervical epithelium showed feeble expression of sirtuin isoforms, SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT7. A significant increase in SIRT1 expression was noted in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of proliferative layers of cervical epithelium in squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL); however, in the squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), a heterogeneous pattern of SIRT1 expression varying from low to high was noted. A progressive increase in the expression of both SIRT2 and SIRT7 was noted during cancer progression in the following order: normal < preneoplasia < cancer. Cervical cancer cell lines, HeLa and SiHa, showed higher levels of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in comparison to the immortalized cell counterpart, HaCaT. Specific inhibitors of SIRT1 (Ex527) and SIRT2 (AGK2) impaired the growth of the cervical cancer cells, SiHa, but not of the HaCaT cells.

The proportion of cases attributable to recessive coding variants was 3.6% in patients of European ancestry, compared with 50% explained by de novo coding mutations. It was higher (31%) in patients with Pakistani ancestry, owing to elevated autozygosity. Half of this recessive burden is attributable to known genes. We identified two genes not previously associated with recessive developmental disorders, KDM5B and EIF3F, and functionally validated them with mouse and cellular models. Our results suggest that recessive coding variants account for a small fraction of currently undiagnosed nonconsanguineous individuals, and that the role of noncoding variants, incomplete penetrance, and polygenic mechanisms need further exploration.",

OBJECTIVE: Semagacestat, a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, demonstrated an unfavorable risk-benefit profile in a Phase 3 study of patients with Alzheimer's disease (IDENTITY trials), and clinical development was halted. To assist in future development of \u03b3-secretase inhibitors, we report detailed safety findings from the IDENTITY study, with emphasis on those that might be mechanistically linked to \u03b3-secretase inhibition. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The IDENTITY trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of semagacestat (100 mg and 140 mg), in which 1537 patients age 55 years and older with probable Alzheimer's disease were randomized. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are reported by body system along with pertinent laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings. RESULTS: Semagacestat treatment was associated with increased reporting of suspected Notch-related adverse events (gastrointestinal, infection, and skin cancer related). Other relevant safety findings associated with semagacestat treatment included cognitive and functional worsening, skin-related TEAEs, renal and hepatic changes, increased QT interval, and weight loss. With few exceptions, differences between semagacestat and placebo treatment groups were no longer significant after cessation of treatment with active drug. CONCLUSIONS: Many of these safety findings can be attributed to \u03b3-secretase inhibition, and may be valuable to researchers developing \u03b3-secretase inhibitors.",

BACKGROUND: In a recent report, 76 weeks' treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (semagacestat) was associated with poorer cognitive outcomes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the effect of semagacestat treatment on neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). METHODS: 1,537 participants with mild to moderate AD were randomized to 76 weeks' treatment with placebo versus two doses of semagacestat. NPS were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Total and subdomains). Cognition was assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (first 11 items, ADAS11). Mixed-Model Repeated Measures was used to compare the effects of treatment assignment on change in NPI-total and subdomains over time. Survival analysis was used to assess the treatment effect on time to first worsening of NPS (NPI-Total > 10 or NPI subdomain > 4) for subjects with no or minor NPS at baseline. RESULTS: Participants on high dose semagecestat (140 mg) had greater increase in NPI-Total and greater risk of incident first worsening in NPI-Total and in subdomains of aberrant motor behavior, appetite, depression/dysphoria, and sleep. ADAS11 increased more in participants whose NPI-Total increased. CONCLUSION: In participants with mild to moderate AD, high dose semagacestat treatment was associated with greater severity and faster worsening of NPS in a pattern resembling an agitated depression. Increased NPS was associated with cognitive decline regardless of treatment assignment. These findings suggest that greater NPS may be the result of gamma-secretase treatment and emphasize the importance of monitoring NPS as potential adverse events in trials of novel treatments for AD.",

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of cortical amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) protein plaques, which result from the sequential action of \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase on amyloid precursor protein. Semagacestat is a small-molecule \u03b3-secretase inhibitor that was developed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 1537 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease underwent randomization to receive 100 mg of semagacestat, 140 mg of semagacestat, or placebo daily. Changes in cognition from baseline to week 76 were assessed with the use of the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale for cognition (ADAS-cog), on which scores range from 0 to 70 and higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment, and changes in functioning were assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale, on which scores range from 0 to 78 and higher scores indicate better functioning. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis was used. RESULTS: The trial was terminated before completion on the basis of a recommendation by the data and safety monitoring board. At termination, there were 189 patients in the group receiving placebo, 153 patients in the group receiving 100 mg of semagacestat, and 121 patients in the group receiving 140 mg of semagacestat. The ADAS-cog scores worsened in all three groups (mean change, 6.4 points in the placebo group, 7.5 points in the group receiving 100 mg of the study drug, and 7.8 points in the group receiving 140 mg; P=0.15 and P=0.07, respectively, for the comparison with placebo). The ADCS-ADL scores also worsened in all groups (mean change at week 76, -9.0 points in the placebo group, -10.5 points in the 100-mg group, and -12.6 points in the 140-mg group; P=0.14 and P<0.001, respectively, for the comparison with placebo). Patients treated with semagacestat lost more weight and had more skin cancers and infections, treatment discontinuations due to adverse events, and serious adverse events (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). Laboratory abnormalities included reduced levels of lymphocytes, T cells, immunoglobulins, albumin, total protein, and uric acid and elevated levels of eosinophils, monocytes, and cholesterol; the urine pH was also elevated. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with placebo, semagacestat did not improve cognitive status, and patients receiving the higher dose had significant worsening of functional ability. Semagacestat was associated with more adverse events, including skin cancers and infections. (Funded by Eli Lilly; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00594568.)",

However, a large phase 3 trial of semagacestat, a potential non-transition state analog (non-TSA) GSI, in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) was terminated due to unexpected aggravation of cognitive deficits and side effects. Here, we show that some semagacestat effects are clearly different from a phenotype caused by a loss of function of presenilins, core proteins in the \u03b3-secretase complex. Semagacestat increases intracellular byproduct peptides, produced along with A\u03b2 through serial \u03b3-cleavage of \u03b2APP, as well as intracellular long A\u03b2 species, in cell-based and in\u00a0vivo studies of AD model mice.

BACKGROUND: Facing a growing workload and dwindling resources, the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) created the Indexing Initiative project in 1996. This cross-library team's mission is to explore indexing methodologies for ensuring quality and currency of NLM document collections. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is the main product of this project and has been providing automated indexing recommendations since 2002. After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant. METHODS: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. To answer the question of MTI relevancy compared to other available tools, we have participated in the 2013 and 2014 BioASQ Challenges. The BioASQ Challenges have provided us with an unbiased comparison between the MTI system and other systems performing the same task. RESULTS: Indexers have continually increased their use of MTI recommendations over the years from 15.75% of the articles they index in 2002 to 62.44% in 2014 showing that the indexers find MTI to be increasingly useful. The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F (+0.1997) with modest gains in Recall (+0.0454) over the years. MTI consistency is comparable to the available indexer consistency studies. MTI performed well in both of the BioASQ Challenges ranking within the top tier teams. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. The BioASQ Challenge results have shown that we need to incorporate more machine learning into MTI while still retaining the indexing rules that have earned MTI the indexers' trust over the years. We also need to expand MTI through the use of full text, when and where it is available, to provide coverage of indexing terms that are typically only found in the full text. The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.",

BACKGROUND: Strimvelis (autologous CD34+ cells transduced to express adenosine deaminase [ADA]) is the first ex vivo stem cell gene therapy approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), indicated as a single treatment for patients with ADA-severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) who lack a suitable matched related bone marrow donor. Existing primary immunodeficiency registries are tailored to transplantation outcomes and do not capture the breadth of safety and efficacy endpoints required by the EMA for the long-term monitoring of gene therapies. Furthermore, for extended monitoring of Strimvelis, the young age of children treated, small patient numbers, and broad geographic distribution of patients all increase the risk of loss to follow-up before sufficient data have been collected. Establishing individual investigator sites would be impractical and uneconomical owing to the small number of patients from each location receiving Strimvelis. RESULTS: An observational registry has been established to monitor the safety and effectiveness of Strimvelis in up to 50 patients over a minimum of 15\u00a0years. To address the potential challenges highlighted above, data will be collected by a single investigator site at Ospedale San Raffaele (OSR), Milan, Italy, and entered into the registry via a central electronic platform. Patients/families and the patient's local physician will also be able to submit healthcare information directly to the registry using a uniquely designed electronic platform. Data entry will be monitored by a Gene Therapy Registry Centre (funded by GlaxoSmithKline) who will ensure that necessary information is collected and flows between OSR, the patient/family and the patient's local healthcare provider. CONCLUSION: The Strimvelis registry sets a precedent for the safety monitoring of future gene therapies. A unique, patient-focused design has been implemented to address the challenges of long-term follow-up of patients treated with gene therapy for a rare disease. Strategies to ensure data completeness and patient retention in the registry will help fulfil pharmacovigilance requirements. Collaboration with partners is being sought to expand from a treatment registry into a disease registry. Using practical and cost-efficient approaches, the Strimvelis registry is hoped to encourage further innovation in registry design within orphan drug development.",

Differentially expressed proteins were validated by Western blot analysis. Precancerous lesions of bladder cancer were more common in non-treated group (77.8%) than in BCG-treated group (50%) and the control group (0%). Greater than twofold changes occurred in the expression of a number of proteins. Among them, Rab-GDI\u03b2, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and 14-3-3 zeta/delta were important since they were previously reported to be associated with cancer and their expression levels were found to be lower in BCG-treated group in comparison to the non-treated group. ALDH2 and 14-3-3 zeta/delta were also found to be highly expressed in the non-treated group compared to the control group. The down-regulation of these proteins and Rab-GDI\u03b2 was achieved with BCG; this result indicates that they may be used as putative biomarkers for monitoring changes in bladder carcinogenesis in response to BCG immunotherapy.",

RESULTS: HER-2 overexpression was a significant predictor of disease-free survival (DFS) in the overall as well as in the two patients' population; as for progression-free survival (PFS), it was significant in the overall but not in the two patients' population. MLH1 was an independent predictor of PFS only in patients treated with BCG and MSH2 failed to predict DFS and PFS in all populations. Most importantly, the higher the number of altered markers the lowers the DFS and PFS. In multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis, the number of altered molecular markers and BCG treatment were significant predictors (p = 0.0004 and 0.0283, respectively) of DFS, whereas the number of altered molecular markers was the only significant predictor (p = 0.0054) of PFS. CONCLUSIONS: Altered expression of the proto-oncogene HER-2 and the two molecular markers of genetic instability MLH1 and MSH2 predicted T1 high-grade BC outcome with the higher the number of altered markers the lower the DFS and PFS.

BACKGROUND: Axitinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2, and 3. A randomised phase 2 trial of gemcitabine with or without axitinib in advanced pancreatic cancer suggested increased overall survival in axitinib-treated patients. On the basis of these results, we aimed to assess the effect of treatment with gemcitabine plus axitinib on overall survival in a phase 3 trial. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, eligible patients had metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, no uncontrolled hypertension or venous thrombosis, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1. Patients, stratified by disease extent (metastatic vs locally advanced), were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days plus either axitinib or placebo. Axitinib or placebo were administered orally with food at a starting dose of 5 mg twice a day, which could be dose-titrated up to 10 mg twice daily if well tolerated. A centralised randomisation procedure was used to assign patients to each treatment group, with randomised permuted blocks within strata. Patients, investigators, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was overall survival. All efficacy analyses were done in all patients assigned to treatment groups for whom data were available; safety and treatment administration and compliance assessments were based on treatment received. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00471146. FINDINGS: Between July 27, 2007, and Oct 31, 2008, 632 patients were enrolled and assigned to treatment groups (316 axitinib, 316 placebo). At an interim analysis in January, 2009, the independent data monitoring committee concluded that the futility boundary had been crossed. Median overall survival was 8\u00b75 months (95% CI 6\u00b79-9\u00b75) for gemcitabine plus axitinib (n=314, data missing for two patients) and 8\u00b73 months (6\u00b79-10\u00b73) for gemcitabine plus placebo (n=316; hazard ratio 1\u00b7014, 95% CI 0\u00b7786-1\u00b7309; one-sided p=0\u00b75436). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events for gemcitabine plus axitinib and gemcitabine plus placebo were hypertension (20 [7%] and 5 [2%] events, respectively), abdominal pain (20 [7%] and 17 [6%]), fatigue (27 [9%] and 21 [7%]), and anorexia (19 [6%] and 11 [4%]).

OBJECTIVE: Axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3. This analysis compared efficacy and safety of axitinib plus gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer from Japan, North America and the European Union, enrolled in a randomized Phase III study. METHODS: Patients (n = 632), stratified by disease extent, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive axitinib/gemcitabine or placebo/gemcitabine.

Common adverse events with axitinib/gemcitabine in Japanese patients were fatigue, anorexia, dysphonia, nausea and decreased platelet count. Axitinib safety profile was generally similar in patients from the three regions, although there were differences in incidence of some adverse events. An exploratory analysis did not show any correlation between axitinib/gemcitabine-related hypertension and overall survival.

Retrospectively, the lack of focus on suicidality in ASD seems surprising when self-injurious behavior has long been a focus of attention in ASD. The emerging studies indicate that the increased risk of self-injurious behavior in younger and less cognitively able children with ASD is matched by an increased risk of suicidality in those at a more advanced developmental level.",

OBJECTIVES: Considering that suicide is one of the most common reasons of adolescent death worldwide, there is a lack of clinical awareness on suicidal behaviors of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study aims to assess the rate of suicidality (suicidal ideation, behaviors and attempts) and associated risk factors for suicidality in high functioning ASD. METHODS: Medical records of 55 adolescents (six girls, 49 boys), aged between 7-20 years, with diagnosis of ASD were reviewed. The participants were all able to speak fluently and had no significant limitations in intellectual functioning. Clinical assessment of participants was carried out on the basis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition, Text Revision criteria and Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version. Eskin's Suicide Screening Questionnaire and sociodemographic data form including detailed history of suicidal behaviors were used. The study group was also divided into suicidal and non-suicidal groups for the purpose of comparing the results. RESULTS: The rate of suicidal behaviors was 29% and suicide attempt was 12.7%. Types of suicidality were behaviors (43.7%), thoughts (37.5%), and verbal declarations (18.7%). A number of bizarre acts were recorded. Rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders and disruptive behaviors were 23.6%, 43.6% and 65.4% respectively. Groups with the psychotic features, positive family history for suicidal behaviors and completed suicide showed more suicidality than the non-suicidal group. CONCLUSION: Consistent with the previous findings, rate of suicidality is higher in individuals with ASD. The type of suicidal behaviors showed some differences compared to typically developing individuals. The presence of psychotic features and positive family history for suicidality may be risk factors for suicidality in children and adolescents with ASD. To prevent suicide and implement protective health care systems, identifying the population at risk is crucial.",

Over 15% of young people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) will contemplate or attempt suicide during adolescence. Yet, there is limited evidence concerning risk factors for suicidality in childhood ASD. Electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to create retrospective clinical cohort data for large samples of children with ASD. However systems to accurately extract suicidality-related concepts need to be developed so that putative models of suicide risk in ASD can be explored. We present a systematic approach to 1) adapt Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions to screen with high sensitivity for reference to suicidal constructs in a large clinical ASD EHR corpus (230,465 documents), and 2) evaluate within a screened subset of 500 patients, the performance of an NLP classification tool for positive and negated suicidal mentions within clinical text. When evaluated, the NLP classification tool showed high system performance for positive suicidality with precision, recall, and F1 scores all > 0.85 at a document and patient level. The application therefore provides accurate output for epidemiological research into the factors contributing to the onset and recurrence of suicidality, and potential utility within clinical settings as an automated surveillance or risk prediction tool for specialist ASD services.",

The purpose of this article is to present the data in the literature regarding the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of suicidality in subjects with autism spectrum disorders and to identify the factors that promote the transition to action. METHODS: This review was carried out using the data set collected in Medline PubMed, items with \"autism spectrum disorder\", \"pervasive developmental disorder\", \"Asperger's syndrome\", \"suicide\", \"suicide attempt\", and \"suicide behavior\". RESULTS: In all subjects from our research on PubMed, 21.3% of subjects with autism spectrum disorder reported suicidal ideation, have attempted suicide or died by suicide (115 out of 539 subjects) and 7.7% of subjects supported for suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide exhibited an autism spectrum disorder (62 out of 806 subjects), all ages combined. Suicidal ideation and morbid preoccupation are particularly common in adolescents and young adults. Suicide attempts are accompanied by a willingness for death and can lead to suicide. They are more common in high-functioning autism and Asperger subjects. The methods used are often violent and potentially lethal or fatal in two cases published. Suicide risk depends on many factors that highlight the vulnerability of these subjects, following autistic and developmental symptoms. Vulnerability complicating the diagnosis of comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders are major factors associated with suicidality. Vulnerability but also directly related to suicidality, since the origin of physical and sexual abuse and victimization by peers assigning them the role of \"scapegoat\" are both responsible for acting out. CONCLUSION: Given the diversity of factors involved in the risk of suicide in this population, this does not validate \"a\" program of intervention, but the intervention of \"customized programs\". Their implementation should be as early as possible in order to treat while the brain has the greatest plasticity. The aim is to provide the necessary access to the greatest possible autonomy. Hence, including working communication skills and interaction, these subject will have independent means of protection, an essential complement to measures to protect vulnerable subjects; the vulnerability of direct and indirect suicidality. Comorbid diagnoses must take into account the specificities of these patients, their difficulties in communicating their mental state, and adapted and innovative therapeutic strategies must be offered and validated.",

BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported a high prevalence of depression among patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and suggested a relationship between ASD and suicidality. However, whether ASD independently increases the risk of attempted suicide regardless of depression has not been determined. METHODS: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 5,618 adolescents aged 12-17 years and young adults aged 18-29 years with ASD (ICD-9-CM code: 299) and 22,472 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled between 2001 and 2009 and followed to the end of 2011. Any suicide attempt was identified during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Patients with ASD had a higher incidence of suicide attempts (3.9% vs 0.7%, P < .001) than did those without ASD. Both adolescents (HR = 5.79; 95% CI, 3.98-8.41) and young adults (HR = 5.38; 95% CI, 3.58-8.06) with ASD were more likely to attempt suicide in later life after adjusting for demographic data and psychiatric comorbidities. Sensitivity analyses after excluding the first year (HR = 4.52; 95% CI, 3.39-6.03) or first 3 years (HR = 3.36; 95% CI, 2.40-4.70) of observation showed consistent findings. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ASD had an increased risk of suicide attempts compared with those without ASD. ASD was an independent risk factor of attempted suicide. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying pathophysiology between ASD and suicidality and to elucidate whether prompt intervention for ASD may reduce this risk.",

Lactotransferrin (LTF) has been shown to regulate tumorogenesis. However, little is known about the role of LTF in regulating the development of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The aim of our study was to investigate whether LTF could regulate the development of NPC by characterizing the pattern of LTF expression in human NPC tissues using cDNA and tissue microarrays. Loss of LTF expression was observed in a significantly higher frequency of NPC tissues compared to that in nontumor nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues. While 61.25% of NPC tissues at the T1/T2 stage were positive for LTF expression, only 40.82% of NPC at the T3/T4 stage were stained by anti-LTF. Similarly, 41.58% of NPC with local lymph node metastasis displayed LTF expression, a value significantly lower than the 46.36% in primary tumors (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that LTF may negatively regulate the development and metastasis of NPC in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of or treatment with LTF inhibited the proliferation of NPC cells and promoted cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase in vitro. While LTF treatment downregulated expression of cyclin D1 and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), expression of p21 and p27 in 5-8F NPC cells was enhanced. Moreover, LTF treatment modulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, but did not affect p53 and STAT3 expression in 5-8F NPC cells. Thus LTF is likely to be a candidate tumor suppressor and downregulates the development of NPC by inhibiting NPC proliferation through induction of cell cycle arrest and modulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore, our findings provide new insights in understanding the mechanism(s) underlying the action of LTF in regulating the development of human NPC.",

In the current study, we screened and identified LTF is a bona fide target of miR-214 in NPC cells. miR-214 mimics significantly suppressed LTF mRNA and protein expression levels in NPC cells. miR-214 not only can promote NPC cell proliferation and invasion abilities in vitro, but also can accelerate tumor formation and lung metastasis in a mouse xenograft model. The pro-tumor function of miR-214 was depended on LTF suppression since LTF re-expression can reverse it. miR-214 can also activate AKT signaling by suppressing LTF expression. Furthermore, miR-214 expression level was up-regulated in NPC especially in metastasis-prone NPC tumor tissues compared with normal nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues, while the LTF expression level was negatively correlated with miR-214, suggesting that miR-214 targeting is partly responsible for LTF down-regulation in NPC specimens.",

Dysregulated activation of numerous genes, including zinc finger, DHHC-type containing 14; caspase-associated recruitment domain-containing protein; and Ras association domain family member 10, have been implicated in GC.

A similar trend in LTF protein expression was observed by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway intermediates p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun were highly expressed in GC tissue samples, and indicated that LTF downregulation may be associated with the dysregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway in GC tissues. In addition, the present study indicated that LTF overexpression reduced the expression of p38, JNK2 and c-Jun in the GC cell line, SGC7901.

However, the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. In the current study, we revealed that LTF can suppress 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 expression via the mitogen-activated protein kinase/c-Jun pathway and thus repress AKT signaling. We also showed that LTF interacts with keratin 18 (K18) and so blocks the formation of the K18-14-3-3 complex, leading to downregulation of K18-mediated AKT activation. Thus, LTF suppresses AKT signaling by two separate mechanisms, leading to inhibition of NPC tumorigenesis.

BACKGROUND: Lactotransferrin (LTF) has been confirmed to act as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers; however, its roles in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), one of malignant head and neck carcinomas, has not been explored. METHODS: Here, the expression of LTF in OSCC tissues and TCA8113 cells was detected with RT-PCR, qPCR, and IHC. And the correlation between LTF expression and OSCC metastasis was assessed. MS-PCR was performed to reveal the methylation status in promoter regions of LTF both in OSCC tissue samples and cells. The influences of 5-Aza-Cdc treatment to the methylation status and expression levels of LTF were also analyzed. At last, the functions of LTF in OSCC progression were demonstrated by MTT analysis, clone formation assay, and cell cycle analysis in TCA8113 cells with forced ectopic expression of LTF. RESULTS: LTF showed a low or null expression pattern in OSCC tissues and cells, at least partially, due to the hypermethylated status in promoter regions for 5-Aza-Cdc, a methyltransferase inhibitor, could restore the expression of LTF in TCA8113 cells. And the expression level of LTF exhibited a negative correlation with OSCC metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Re-expression of LTF inhibited the growth, proliferation, as well as cell cycle progression of TCA8113 cells. In conclusion, hypermethylation contributes much to LTF inactivation in OSCC. And LTF can partially reverse the malignant phenotypes of OSCC cells and may be served as a potential target for diagnosis and therapy of OSCC in future.",

AIMS: There is increasing evidence showing that mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is associated with increased depression-related disorders in humans. Recent studies suggest that dietary intake or supplementation of natural flavonoids like hesperidin can be used for therapy of patients with brain injury and depression. However, the exact mechanisms by which hesperidin indicates its neuroprotective effects are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of hesperidin on depression-related symptoms in a mouse model of mTBI, and that what mechanisms are primarily involved in the antidepressant effects of this bioflavonoid. MAIN METHODS: Ten days after mTBI-induction, mice received oral hesperidin treatment (50 mg/kg/14 days), then animals were subjected to different depression tests including sucrose preference test, forced swim test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, and tail suspension test. We also measured levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin-(IL)-1\u03b2, malondialdehyde (MDA), and brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. KEY FINDINGS: Our results show that mTBI induction induced depressive-like behaviors in mice by increasing inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) and oxidative stress marker (MDA), and reducing BDNF levels in the hippocampus. Interestingly, hesperidin treatment was effective to significantly reduce depression-related symptoms in mTBI-induced mice. In addition, hesperidin decreased the levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and MDA, and increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus. The major strength of our study is that four behavioral tests gave similar results. SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that the antidepressant-like effect of hesperidin may be mediated, at least in part, by decreased neuroinflammation and oxidative damage, and enhanced BDNF production in the hippocampus.",

METHODS: Forty albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups of n\u00a0= 8 in each: group (G)1, no experimental interventions; G2, subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage; G3, subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage and administered saline (100 mg/kg); G4, subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage and treated with low-dose hesperidin (50 mg/kg); and G5, subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage and treated with high-dose hesperidin (100 mg/kg). Subarachnoid hemorrhage was created by injecting 0.15 cc of autologous blood taken from the rat-tail artery and injected into the cisterna magna from the craniocervical junction. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally as twice daily doses for 48 hours. Rats were euthanized at the end of this period. RESULTS: No statistically significant decrease was observed in malondialdehyde levels, which is the end-product of lipid peroxidation, among the drug groups (G4 and G5). Thin sections prepared from the basilar artery were examined morphologically. Severe luminal narrowing and vessel-wall thickening were observed in the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups (G2, G3). In the hesperidin-administered groups (G4, G5), it was determined that vessel wall thickness measurements revealed thinner walls than in the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups (G2, G3) and the luminal diameters were significantly larger than in the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups (G2, G3). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that hesperidin has no effect on malondialdehyde-associated lipid-peroxidation activity; however, it might be useful in subarachnoid hemorrhage therapy because of its beneficial effects on vessel wall thickness and luminal diameters.",

MOTIVATION: Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins play an essential role in the regulation of various biological processes. Key to their regulatory function is often the binding to globular protein domains via sequence elements known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Development of computational tools for the identification of candidate MoRF locations in amino acid sequences is an important task and an area of growing interest. Given the relative sparseness of MoRFs in protein sequences, the accuracy of the available MoRF predictors is often inadequate for practical usage, which leaves a significant need and room for improvement. In this work, we introduce MoRFCHiBi_Web, which predicts MoRF locations in protein sequences with higher accuracy compared to current MoRF predictors. METHODS: Three distinct and largely independent property scores are computed with component predictors and then combined to generate the final MoRF propensity scores. The first score reflects the likelihood of sequence windows to harbour MoRFs and is based on amino acid composition and sequence similarity information. It is generated by MoRFCHiBi using small windows of up to 40 residues in size. The second score identifies long stretches of protein disorder and is generated by ESpritz with the DisProt option. Lastly, the third score reflects residue conservation and is assembled from PSSM files generated by PSI-BLAST. These propensity scores are processed and then hierarchically combined using Bayes rule to generate the final MoRFCHiBi_Web predictions. RESULTS: MoRFCHiBi_Web was tested on three datasets. Results show that MoRFCHiBi_Web outperforms previously developed predictors by generating less than half the false positive rate for the same true positive rate at practical threshold values. This level of accuracy paired with its relatively high processing speed makes MoRFCHiBi_Web a practical tool for MoRF prediction. AVAILABILITY: http://morf.chibi.ubc.ca:8080/morf/.",

Motivation: Intrinsically disordered proteins lack stable 3-dimensional structure and play a crucial role in performing various biological functions. Key to their biological function are the molecular recognition features (MoRFs) located within long disordered regions. Computationally identifying these MoRFs from disordered protein sequences is a challenging task. In this study, we present a new MoRF predictor, OPAL, to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. OPAL utilizes two independent sources of information computed using different component predictors. The scores are processed and combined using common averaging method. The first score is computed using a component MoRF predictor which utilizes composition and sequence similarity of MoRF and non-MoRF regions to detect MoRFs. The second score is calculated using half-sphere exposure (HSE), solvent accessible surface area (ASA) and backbone angle information of the disordered protein sequence, using information from the amino acid properties of flanks surrounding the MoRFs to distinguish MoRF and non-MoRF residues. Results: OPAL is evaluated using test sets that were previously used to evaluate MoRF predictors, MoRFpred, MoRFchibi and MoRFchibi-web. The results demonstrate that OPAL outperforms all the available MoRF predictors and is the most accurate predictor available for MoRF prediction.

MOTIVATION: Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins play an essential role in the regulation of various biological processes. Key to their regulatory function is the binding of molecular recognition features (MoRFs) to globular protein domains in a process known as a disorder-to-order transition. Predicting the location of MoRFs in protein sequences with high accuracy remains an important computational challenge. METHOD: In this study, we introduce MoRFCHiBi, a new computational approach for fast and accurate prediction of MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFCHiBi combines the outcomes of two support vector machine (SVM) models that take advantage of two different kernels with high noise tolerance. The first, SVMS, is designed to extract maximal information from the general contrast in amino acid compositions between MoRFs, their surrounding regions (Flanks), and the remainders of the sequences. The second, SVMT, is used to identify similarities between regions in a query sequence and MoRFs of the training set. RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of our predictor by comparing its results with those of two currently available MoRF predictors, MoRFpred and ANCHOR. Using three test sets that have previously been collected and used to evaluate MoRFpred and ANCHOR, we demonstrate that MoRFCHiBi outperforms the other predictors with respect to different evaluation metrics. In addition, MoRFCHiBi is downloadable and fast, which makes it useful as a component in other computational prediction tools. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/morf/.",

MoRFs facilitate translation, transport, signaling, and regulatory processes and are found across all domains of life. A popular computational tool, MoRFpred, accurately predicts MoRFs in protein sequences.

Upon interaction they undergo a disorder-to-order transition as a result of which their functionality arises. Predicting these MoRFs in disordered protein sequences is a challenging task.

Computational prediction of MoRFs helps identify the potentially functional regions in IDRs. In this study, OPAL+, a novel MoRF predictor, is presented. OPAL+ uses separate models to predict MoRFs of varying lengths along with incorporating the hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles and physicochemical properties of MoRFs and their flanking regions. Together, these features help OPAL+ achieve a marginal performance improvement of 0.4-0.7% over its predecessor for diverse MoRF test sets.

Therefore, there is an emerging interest in generating cardiosphere-like stem cells from somatic cells via somatic reprogramming. This novel approach would provide an unlimited source of stem cells with cardiac differentiation potential.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides derive from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and play a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Our previous work showed that the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which is produced simultaneously with A\u03b2, also contributes to the development of AD-like features. Studies show that administration of apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apoE-derived small peptide mimetics protect AD mouse models against these AD-like features. However, the effects of apoE-mimetic treatment on AICD-mediated AD-like pathologies remain to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of an apoE mimetic (COG112) on neuroinflammation, hyperphosphorylation of tau and defects in adult neurogenesis in AICD- overexpressing transgenic mice (FeC\u03b325 line). METHODS: Beginning at 1 month of age, animals were administered subcutaneous COG112 3 times per week for 3 months, followed by immunohistochemical analysis for neuroinflammation, neurogenesis and phosphorylated tau. RESULTS: Treatment with COG112 significantly reduced neuroinflammation in AICD mice and protected against impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis. We also found that COG112 treatment reduced hyperphosphorylation and somatodendritic accumulation of tau in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of AICD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of neuroinflammation by the apoE-mimetic COG112 protects against impaired neurogenesis and tau pathology in AICD transgenic mice. These data suggest that neuroinflammation plays an important role in AICD-induced AD-like pathologies.",
