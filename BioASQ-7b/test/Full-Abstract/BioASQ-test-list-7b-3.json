The acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) localizes to the lumen of endosomes, phagosomes and lysosomes as well as to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and hydrolyses sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Using the facultative intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, we show that maturation of phagosomes into phagolysosomes is severely impaired in macrophages genetically deficient for ASMase. Unlike in wild-type macrophages, phagosomes containing L. monocytogenes in ASMase(-/-) macrophages remained positive for the late phagosomal markers mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) and Rab7 for at least 2 h and, correspondingly, showed delayed acquisition of lysosomal markers like lysosome associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1). The transfer of lysosomal fluid phase markers into phagosomes containing L. monocytogenes was severely impaired in ASMase(-/-) macrophages and decreased with increasing size of the cargo. Moreover, phagosomes containing L. monocytogenes from ASMase(-/-) cells acquired significantly less listeriocidal proteases cathepsin D, B and L. The results of this study suggest that ASMase is required for the proper fusion of late phagosomes with lysosomes, which is crucial for efficient transfer of lysosomal antibacterial hydrolases into phagosomes.",

Promastigote form of Leishmania, an intracellular pathogen, delays phagosome maturation and resides inside macrophages. But till date limited study has been done to manipulate the phagosomal machinery of macrophages to restrict Leishmania growth. Attenuated Leishmania strain exposed RAW 264.7 cells showed a respiratory burst and enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators. The augmentation of pro-inflammatory activity is mostly attributed to p38 MAPK and p44/42 MAPK. In our study, these activated macrophages are found to induce phagosome maturation when infected with pathogenic Leishmania donovani. Increased co-localization of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester labeled pathogenic L. donovani with Lysosome was found. Moreover, increased co-localization was observed between pathogenic L. donovani and late phagosomal markers viz. Rab7, Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 1, Cathepsin D, Rab9, and V-ATPase which indicate phagosome maturation. It was also observed that inhibition of V-type ATPase caused significant hindrance in attenuated Leishmania induced phagosome maturation. Finally, it was confirmed that p38 MAPK is the key player in acidification and maturation of phagosome in attenuated Leishmania strain pre-exposed macrophages. To our knowledge, this study for the first time reported an approach to induce phagosome maturation in L. donovani infected macrophages which could potentiate short-term prophylactic response in future.",

Phagolysosomal trafficking is an important innate defense pathway that clears microbes by delivering them to lysosomes, the degradative compartment of the cell. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis, subverts this host defense mechanism by arresting maturation of the phagosome. The ability of Mtb to arrest its delivery to the lysosome can be demonstrated by the prolonged co-localization of bacteria containing phagosomes/vacuole with early phagosomal markers [such as, Ras-related proteins in the brain 5 (Rab5) and Transferrin receptor (TfR)], and a failure to acquire late phagosomal and lysosomal markers (such as Rab7 and LAMP1) (Deretic and Fratti, 1999, Mehra et al., 2013). Here, a protocol is outlined for infection of macrophages with mycobacterial species like pathogenic Mtb, vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis- bacillus Calmatte- Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) and rapidly dividing non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmeg), followed by indirect-immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize host vacuolar markers. Thereafter, automated quantification of degree of co-localization between mycobacteria and host vacuolar markers like TfR and LAMP1 is done by processing the binary images of bacteria using mathematical tools. This results in quantification of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of these host markers directly around the bacteria/bacterial clusters with increased sensitivity relative to when done manually. By manipulating host or pathogen, this assay can be used to evaluate host or bacterial determinants of intracellular trafficking. The basic method can be applied to studying trafficking of other bacteria or particles like beads, although the kinetics of infection and phagosome maturation will depend upon the phagocytic cargo. The mathematical analysis tools are available in many standard imaging analysis programs. However, any adaption for similar analysis should be confirmed by the individual user with their imaging and analysis platform.",

Strains of the Burkholderia cepacia complex can survive within macrophages by arresting the maturation of phagocytic vacuoles.

Using murine macrophages, we investigated the stage at which maturation is arrested and analyzed the underlying mechanism. Vacuoles containing B. cenocepacia strain J2315, an isolate of the transmissible ET12 clone, recruited Rab5 and synthesized phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, indicating progression to the early phagosomal stage. Despite the fact that the B. cenocepacia-containing vacuoles rarely fused with lysosomes, they could nevertheless acquire the late phagosomal markers CD63 and Rab7. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and use of a probe that detects Rab7-guanosine triphosphate indicated that activation of Rab7 was impaired by B. cenocepacia, accounting at least in part for the inability of the vacuole to merge with lysosomes. The Rab7 defect was not due to excessive cholesterol accumulation and was confined to the infected vacuoles. Jointly, these experiments indicate that B. cenocepacia express virulence factors capable of interfering with Rab7 function and thereby with membrane traffic.",

Histophilus somni is capable of intracellular survival within professional phagocytic cells, but the mechanism of survival is not understood. The Fic motif within the direct repeat (DR1)/DR2 domains of the IbpA fibrillary network protein of H. somni is cytotoxic to epithelial and phagocytic cells, which may interfere with the bactericidal activity of these cells. To determine the contribution of IbpA and Fic to resistance to host defenses, H. somni strains and mutants that lacked all or a region of ibpA (including the DR1/DR2 regions) were tested for survival in bovine monocytic cells and for serum susceptibility. An H. somni mutant lacking IbpA, but not the DR1/DR2 region within ibpA, was more susceptible to killing by antiserum than the parent, indicating that the entire protein was associated with serum resistance. H. somni strains expressing IbpA replicated in bovine monocytes for at least 72 h and were toxic for these cells. Virulent strain 2336 mutants lacking the entire ibpA gene or both DR1 and DR2 were not toxic to the monocytes but still survived within the monocytes for at least 72 h. Monitoring of intracellular trafficking of H. somni with monoclonal antibodies to phagosomal markers indicated that the early phagosomal marker early endosome antigen 1 colocalized with all isolates tested, but only strains that could survive intracellularly did not colocalize with the late lysosomal marker lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 and prevented the acidification of phagosomes. These results indicated that virulent isolates of H. somni were capable of surviving within phagocytic cells through interference in phagosome-lysosome maturation. Therefore, H. somni may be considered a permissive intracellular pathogen.",

Delafloxacin is a broad-spectrum anionic fluoroquinolone under development for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. The goal of the study was to determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets in the murine lung infection model for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae Four isolates of each species were utilized for in vivo studies: for S. aureus, one methicillin-susceptible and three methicillin-resistant isolates; S. pneumoniae, two penicillin-susceptible and two penicillin-resistant isolates; K. pneumoniae, one wild-type and three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates. MICs were determined using CLSI methods. A neutropenic murine lung infection model was utilized for all treatment studies, and drug dosing was by the subcutaneous route. Single-dose plasma pharmacokinetics was determined in the mouse model after administration of 2.5, 10, 40, and 160 mg/kg. For in vivo studies, 4-fold-increasing doses of delafloxacin (range, 0.03 to 160 mg/kg) were administered every 6 h (q6h) to infected mice. Treatment outcome was measured by determining organism burden in the lung (CFU counts) at the end of each experiment (24 h). The Hill equation for maximum effect (Emax) was used to model the dose-response data. The magnitude of the PK/PD index, the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC), associated with net stasis and 1-log kill endpoints was determined in the lung model for all isolates. MICs ranged from 0.004 to 1 mg/liter. Single-dose PK parameter ranges include the following: for maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax), 2 to 70.7 mg/liter; AUC from 0 h to infinity (AUC0-\u221e), 2.8 to 152 mg \u00b7 h/liter; half-life (t1/2), 0.7 to 1 h. At the start of therapy mice had 6.3 \u00b1 0.09 log10 CFU/lung. In control mice the organism burden increased 2.1 \u00b1 0.44 log10 CFU/lung over the study period. There was a relatively steep dose-response relationship observed with escalating doses of delafloxacin. Maximal organism reductions ranged from 2 log10 to more than 4 log10 The median free-drug AUC/MIC magnitude associated with net stasis for each species group was 1.45, 0.56, and 40.3 for S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae, respectively. AUC/MIC targets for the 1-log kill endpoint were 2- to 5-fold higher. Delafloxacin demonstrated in vitro and in vivo potency against a diverse group of pathogens, including those with phenotypic drug resistance to other classes. These results have potential relevance for clinical dose selection and evaluation of susceptibility breakpoints for delafloxacin for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections involving these pathogens.",

In this endeavor, an in depth analysis of shotgun experiments might represent a valuable resource to select a biological matrix in design validation experiments. In this work, we used all the proteomic experiments from the NCI60 cell lines and applied an integrative approach based on the results obtained from Comet, Mascot, OMSSA, and X!Tandem. This workflow benefits from the complementarity of these search engines to increase the proteome coverage. Five missing proteins C-HPP guidelines compliant were identified, although further validation is needed. Moreover, 165 missing proteins were detected with only one unique peptide, and their functional analysis supported their participation in cellular pathways as was also proposed in other studies. Finally, we performed a combined analysis of the gene expression levels and the proteomic identifications from the common cell lines between the NCI60 and the CCLE project to suggest alternatives for further validation of missing protein observations.",

In mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics, protein identifications are usually the desired result. However, most of the analytical methods are based on the identification of reliable peptides and not the direct identification of intact proteins. Thus, assembling peptides identified from tandem mass spectra into a list of proteins, referred to as protein inference, is a critical step in proteomics research. Currently, different protein inference algorithms and tools are available for the proteomics community. Here, we evaluated five software tools for protein inference (PIA, ProteinProphet, Fido, ProteinLP, MSBayesPro) using three popular database search engines: Mascot, X!Tandem, and MS-GF+. All the algorithms were evaluated using a highly customizable KNIME workflow using four different public datasets with varying complexities (different sample preparation, species and analytical instruments). We defined a set of quality control metrics to evaluate the performance of each combination of search engines, protein inference algorithm, and parameters on each dataset. We show that the results for complex samples vary not only regarding the actual numbers of reported protein groups but also concerning the actual composition of groups. Furthermore, the robustness of reported proteins when using databases of differing complexities is strongly dependant on the applied inference algorithm. Finally, merging the identifications of multiple search engines does not necessarily increase the number of reported proteins, but does increase the number of peptides per protein and thus can generally be recommended. SIGNIFICANCE: Protein inference is one of the major challenges in MS-based proteomics nowadays. Currently, there are a vast number of protein inference algorithms and implementations available for the proteomics community. Protein assembly impacts in the final results of the research, the quantitation values and the final claims in the research manuscript. Even though protein inference is a crucial step in proteomics data analysis, a comprehensive evaluation of the many different inference methods has never been performed. Previously Journal of proteomics has published multiple studies about other benchmark of bioinformatics algorithms (PMID: 26585461; PMID: 22728601) in proteomics studies making clear the importance of those studies for the proteomics community and the journal audience. This manuscript presents a new bioinformatics solution based on the KNIME/OpenMS platform that aims at providing a fair comparison of protein inference algorithms (https://github.com/KNIME-OMICS). Six different algorithms - ProteinProphet, MSBayesPro, ProteinLP, Fido and PIA- were evaluated using the highly customizable workflow on four public datasets with varying complexities. Five popular database search engines Mascot, X!Tandem, MS-GF+ and combinations thereof were evaluated for every protein inference tool. In total >186 proteins lists were analyzed and carefully compare using three metrics for quality assessments of the protein inference results: 1) the numbers of reported proteins, 2) peptides per protein, and the 3) number of uniquely reported proteins per inference method, to address the quality of each inference method. We also examined how many proteins were reported by choosing each combination of search engines, protein inference algorithms and parameters on each dataset. The results show that using 1) PIA or Fido seems to be a good choice when studying the results of the analyzed workflow, regarding not only the reported proteins and the high-quality identifications, but also the required runtime. 2) Merging the identifications of multiple search engines gives almost always more confident results and increases the number of peptides per protein group. 3) The usage of databases containing not only the canonical, but also known isoforms of proteins has a small impact on the number of reported proteins. The detection of specific isoforms could, concerning the question behind the study, compensate for slightly shorter reports using the parsimonious reports. 4) The current workflow can be easily extended to support new algorithms and search engine combinations.",

TEMPI syndrome (telangiectasias, elevated erythropoietin level and erythrocytosis, monoclonal gammopathy, perinephric fluid collections, and intrapulmonary shunting) is a recently described syndrome that, owing to erythrocytosis, may be confused with polycythemia vera. It is best classified as a type of plasma cell dyscrasia with paraneoplastic manifestations, similar to POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin abnormalities). To date, 11 patients have been identified. This is the first morphologic review of TEMPI syndrome bone marrow samples, in order to define pathologic features that may aid in the recognition of the syndrome and to identify post-therapy changes. Seven bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from three patients, including two post-treatment marrows, were examined. Patients were 36, 49, and 49 years old at time of diagnosis. In all cases, erythropoietin levels were extremely elevated at >5000 IU/l, the paraprotein was IgG kappa, JAK2 V617F was negative and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were normal. In one case, the increase in clonal plasma cells reached levels of smoldering myeloma (18%), but remaining marrows showed few monoclonal plasma cells (<5%). All pre-treatment biopsies showed erythroid hyperplasia, with mild nonspecific megakaryocytic, and erythroid cytologic atypia in one marrow. Prominent plasma cell vacuolization and reactive-appearing lymphoid aggregates were noted in one case. Findings of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including megakaryocyte clusters and fibrosis, were not identified. In conclusion, TEMPI syndrome should be considered when erythrocytosis and plasma cell dyscrasia coexist. The bone marrow findings, although nonspecific, differ significantly from polycythemia vera. Peculiar clinical and laboratorial findings of TEMPI, including elevated erythropoietin and normal vascular endothelial growth factor level, allow the diagnosis and distinction from POEMS syndrome.

Amyloidosis, macroglobulinoderma and follicular hyperkeratotic spicules result from extravascular immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin-related protein deposition. Skin findings include papules and plaques, follicular spicules, purpura, haemorrhagic bullae, macroglossia and nail changes. The skin findings in cryoglobulinemia (CG) result from vascular immunoglobulin deposition, either as immune complexes within the vessel walls in mixed CG or within the lumina of small vessels in monoclonal CG. Mixed CG manifests as palpable purpura of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and monoclonal CG as stellar and/or retiform purpura that can evolve into extensive skin necrosis. In some rare instances, immunoglobulins have a specific biological activity. This is, for example, the case when they bind lipoproteins that precipitate and induce hypocomplementemic xanthomas. Xanthoderma related to antiflavin activity of the monoclonal component or acquired angioedema related to anti-C1INH activity is other example. Abnormal cytokine secretion is the hallmark of some entities. High vascular endothelial growth factor levels correlate with some of the skin manifestations of the Polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal component skin changes syndrome, such as hypertrichosis or the adenopathy and extensive skin patch overlying plasmacytoma syndrome. All the clinical manifestations of the Schnitzler syndrome are IL-1 mediated. In other MGCS, such as scleromyxedema, Clarkson syndrome, TEMPI syndrome, cutis laxa and the neutrophilic dermatoses, the link between the monoclocal component and the entity is clearly established, but not understood so far.",

In this study, to investigate whether the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway influences SS development, female C57BL/6 mice were injected with a STING agonist, dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA). Salivary glands (SGs) were studied for gene expression and inflammatory cell infiltration. SG function was evaluated by measuring pilocarpine-induced salivation. Sera were analyzed for cytokines and autoantibodies. Primary SG cells were used to study the expression and activation of STING. Our data show that systemic DMXAA treatment rapidly induced the expression of Ifnb1, Il6, and Tnfa in the SGs, and these cytokines were also elevated in circulation. In contrast, increased Ifng gene expression was dominantly detected in the SGs. The type I innate lymphoid cells present within the SGs were the major source of IFN-\u03b3, and their numbers increased significantly within 3 d of treatment. STING expression in SGs was mainly observed in ductal and interstitial cells. In primary SG cells, DMXAA activated STING and induced IFN-\u03b2 production. The DMXAA-treated mice developed autoantibodies, sialoadenitis, and glandular hypofunction. Our study demonstrates that activation of the STING pathway holds the potential to initiate SS. Thus, apart from viral infections, conditions that cause cellular perturbations and accumulation of host DNA within the cytosol should also be considered as possible triggers for SS.",

The cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway may play an integral role in the initiation of antitumor immune responses. Studies evaluating the immunogenicity of various cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) STING agonists administered by intratumoral (i.t.) injection showed potent induction of inflammation, tumor necrosis, and, in some cases, durable tumor-specific adaptive immunity. However, the specific immune mechanisms underlying these responses remain incompletely defined. The majority of these studies have focused on the effect of CDNs on immune cells but have not conclusively interrogated the role of stromal cells in the acute rejection of the CDN-injected tumor. Here, we revealed a mechanism of STING agonist-mediated tumor response that relied on both stromal and immune cells to achieve tumor regression and clearance. Using knockout and bone marrow chimeric mice, we showed that although bone marrow-derived TNF\u03b1 was necessary for CDN-induced necrosis, STING signaling in radioresistant stromal cells was also essential for CDN-mediated tumor rejection. These results provide evidence for crosstalk between stromal and hematopoietic cells during CDN-mediated tumor collapse after i.t. administration.

Most FDA-approved adjuvants for infectious agents boost humoral but not cellular immunity, and have poorly-understood mechanisms. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as MITA, MPYS, or ERIS) is an exciting adjuvant target due to its role in cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-driven anti-viral immunity; however, a major hindrance is STING's cytosolic localization which requires intracellular delivery of its agonists. As a result, STING agonists administered in a soluble form have elicited suboptimal immune responses. Delivery of STING agonists via particle platforms has proven a more successful strategy, but the opportunity for improved formulations and bioactivity remains. In this study we evaluated the adjuvant activity of the potent STING agonist, CDN 3'3'-cGAMP (cGAMP), encapsulated in acid-sensitive acetalated dextran (Ace-DEX) polymeric microparticles (MPs) which passively target antigen-presenting cells for intracellular release. This formulation was superior to all particle delivery systems evaluated and maintained its bioactivity following a sterilizing dose of gamma irradiation. Compared to soluble cGAMP, the Ace-DEX cGAMP MPs enhanced type-I interferon responses nearly 1000-fold in vitro and 50-fold in vivo, caused up to a 10-fold boost in antibody titers, increased Th1-associated responses, and expanded germinal center B cells and memory T cells. Furthermore, the encapsulated cGAMP elicited no observable toxicity in animals and achieved protective immunity against a lethal influenza challenge seven months post-immunization when using CDN adjuvant doses up to 100-fold lower than previous reports. For these reasons, Ace-DEX MP-encapsulated cGAMP represents a potent vaccine adjuvant of humoral and cellular immunity.",

Metabolic and inflammatory pathways crosstalk at many levels, and, while required for homeostasis, interaction between these pathways can also lead to metabolic dysregulation under conditions of chronic stress. Thus, we hypothesized that mechanisms might exist to prevent overt inflammatory responses during physiological fluctuations in nutrients or under nutrient-rich conditions, and we identified the six-transmembrane protein STAMP2 as a critical modulator of this integrated response system of inflammation and metabolism in adipocytes. Lack of STAMP2 in adipocytes results in aberrant inflammatory responses to both nutrients and acute inflammatory stimuli. Similarly, in whole animals, visceral adipose tissue of STAMP2(-/-) mice exhibits overt inflammation, and these mice develop spontaneous metabolic disease on a regular diet, manifesting insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, mild hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease.

Six transmembrane protein of prostate (Stamp) proteins play an important role in prostate cancer cell growth. Recently, we found that Stamp2 has a critical role in the integration of inflammatory and metabolic signals in adipose tissue where it is highly expressed and regulated by nutritional and metabolic cues. In this study, we show that all Stamp family members are differentially regulated during adipogenesis: whereas Stamp1 expression is significantly decreased upon differentiation, Stamp2 expression is increased. In contrast, Stamp3 expression is modestly changed in adipocytes compared to preadipocytes, and has a biphasic expression pattern during the course of differentiation. Suppression of Stamp1 or Stamp2 expression both led to inhibition of 3T3-L1 differentiation in concert with diminished expression of the key regulators of adipogenesis - CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/ebp\u03b1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Ppar\u03b3). Upon Stamp1 knockdown, mitotic clonal expansion was also inhibited. In contrast, Stamp2 knockdown did not affect mitotic clonal expansion, but resulted in a marked decrease in superoxide production that is known to affect adipogenesis.

CONTEXT: Six transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) is a counterregulator of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance in mice. Our hypothesis was that STAMP2 could be involved in human obesity and insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to elucidate the role of adipose STAMP2 expression in human obesity and insulin resistance. DESIGN: The design was to quantify STAMP2 in human abdominal sc and omental white adipose tissue (WAT), isolated adipocytes, and stroma and in vitro differentiated preadipocytes and relate levels of STAMP2 in sc WAT to clinical and adipocyte phenotypes involved in insulin resistance. PARTICIPANTS: Nonobese and obese women and men (n = 236) recruited from an obesity clinic or through local advertisement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Clinical measures included body mass index, body fat, total adiponectin, and homeostasis model assessment as measure of overall insulin resistance. In adipocytes we determined cell size, sensitivity of lipolysis and lipogenesis to insulin, adiponectin secretion, and inflammatory gene expression. RESULTS: STAMP2 levels in sc and visceral WAT and adipocytes were increased in obesity (P = 0.0008-0.05) but not influenced by weight loss. Increased WAT STAMP2 levels associated with a high amount of body fat (P = 0.04), high homeostasis model assessment (P = 0.01), and large adipocytes (P = 0.02). Subjects with high STAMP2 levels displayed reduced sensitivity of adipocyte lipogenesis (P = 0.04) and lipolysis (P = 0.03) to insulin but had normal adiponectin levels. WAT STAMP2 levels correlated with expression of the macrophage marker CD68 (P = 0.0006). CONCLUSION: Human WAT STAMP2 associates with obesity and insulin resistance independently of adiponectin, but the role of STAMP2 in obesity and its complications seems different from that in mice.",

METHODS: We randomly assigned adults in a 1:1 ratio to receive either nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram of body weight) plus ipilimumab (1 mg per kilogram) intravenously every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram) every 2 weeks, or sunitinib (50 mg) orally once daily for 4 weeks (6-week cycle). The coprimary end points were overall survival (alpha level, 0.04), objective response rate (alpha level, 0.001), and progression-free survival (alpha level, 0.009) among patients with intermediate or poor prognostic risk. RESULTS: A total of 1096 patients were assigned to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab (550 patients) or sunitinib (546 patients); 425 and 422, respectively, had intermediate or poor risk. At a median follow-up of 25.2 months in intermediate- and poor-risk patients, the 18-month overall survival rate was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70 to 78) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 60% (95% CI, 55 to 65) with sunitinib; the median overall survival was not reached with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 26.0 months with sunitinib (hazard ratio for death, 0.63; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 42% versus 27% (P<0.001), and the complete response rate was 9% versus 1%. The median progression-free survival was 11.6 months and 8.4 months, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.82; P=0.03, not significant per the prespecified 0.009 threshold). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 509 of 547 patients (93%) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 521 of 535 patients (97%) in the sunitinib group; grade 3 or 4 events occurred in 250 patients (46%) and 335 patients (63%), respectively.

The german kidney tumor guideline strongly recommends Nivolumab and Cabozantinib as 2nd line treatments after prior VEGF targeted therapy. CheckMate 025, the prospective randomized trial which led to approval of Nivolumab demonstrated improved overall survival (26 month vs. 19.7 month; hazard ratio 0.73; p = 0.0006) and response rate (26 % vs. 5 %) as well as a favorable toxicity profile compared with Everolimus. Currently, numerous combinations with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are compared to Sunitinib as first line treatment of mRCC. Out of these CheckMate 214, a randomized phase-3 trial is the first to demonstrate a significant higher objective response rate (42 % vs. 27 %, p < 0.0001) and overall survival (Sunitinib 26.0 month, median for Nivo + Ipi has been not yet reached (28.2 - NR); Hazard ratio 0.63) for the combination of Nivolumab and the CTLA-4 antibody Ipilimumab in IMDC intermediate and high risk patients. Furthermore, CheckMate 214 shows better side effect profile and quality of life in patients receiving Nivolumab and Ipilimumab compared with Sunitinib. However, a considerable increase of immune related adverse events is associated with the immune combination therapy. Another randomized trial demonstrates improved progression-free survival for the combination of the PD-L1 inhibitor Atezolizumab and the VEGF antibody Bevacizumab in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors; this was found in all IMDC risk groups.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is responsible for life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals and can cause serious congenital malformations. Available antivirals target the viral polymerase but are subject to cross-resistance and toxicity. New antivirals targeting other replication steps and inducing fewer adverse effects are therefore needed. During HCMV replication, DNA maturation and packaging are performed by the terminase complex, which cleaves DNA to package the genome into the capsid. Identified in herpesviruses and bacteriophages, and with no counterpart in mammalian cells, these terminase proteins are ideal targets for highly specific antivirals. A new terminase inhibitor, letermovir, recently proved effective against HCMV in phase III clinical trials, but the mechanism of action is unclear. Letermovir has no significant activity against other herpesvirus or non-human CMV. This review focuses on the highly conserved mechanism of HCMV DNA-packaging and the potential of the terminase complex to serve as an antiviral target. We describe the intrinsic mechanism of DNA-packaging, highlighting the structure-function relationship of HCMV terminase complex components.",

Letermovir is a human cytomegalovirus terminase inhibitor for cytomegalovirus infection prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Posaconazole (POS), a substrate of glucuronosyltransferase and P-glycoprotein, and voriconazole (VRC), a substrate of CYP2C9/19, are commonly administered to transplant recipients. Because coadministration of these azoles with letermovir is expected, the effect of letermovir on exposure to these antifungals was investigated. Two trials were conducted in healthy female subjects 18 to 55 years of age. In trial 1, single-dose POS 300\u00a0mg was administered alone, followed by a 7-day washout; then letermovir 480\u00a0mg once daily was given for 14 days with POS 300\u00a0mg coadministered on day 14. In trial 2, on day 1 VRC 400\u00a0mg was given every 12 hours; on days 2 and 3, VRC 200\u00a0mg was given every 12 hours, and on day 4 VRC 200\u00a0mg. On days 5 to 8, letermovir 480\u00a0mg was given once daily. Days 9 to 12 repeated days 1 to 4 coadministered with letermovir 480\u00a0mg once daily. In both trials, blood samples were collected for the assessment of the pharmacokinetic profiles of the antifungals, and safety was assessed. The geometric mean ratios (90%CIs) for POS+letermovir/POS area under the curve and peak concentration were 0.98 (0.83, 1.17) and 1.11 (0.95, 1.29), respectively. Voriconazole+letermovir/VRC area under the curve and peak concentration geometric mean ratios were 0.56 (0.51, 0.62) and 0.61 (0.53, 0.71), respectively. All treatments were generally well tolerated. Letermovir did not affect POS pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent but decreased VRC exposure. These results suggest that letermovir may be a perpetrator of CYP2C9/19-mediated drug-drug interactions.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common opportunistic infection after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CMV surveillance-preemptive therapy is the current preferred approach for preventing CMV disease after HSCT. In contrast, antiviral prophylaxis is not commonly used due to myelosuppressive effects of valganciclovir. In this article, the role of the newly approved antiviral compound, letermovir, is reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Letermovir inhibits CMV by interfering viral terminase complex. In a phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled clinical study that enrolled 495 CMV-seropositive HSCT recipients, the primary end point of clinically significant CMV infection was significantly reduced by letermovir prophylaxis. Letermovir was well tolerated without risk of myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Experimental in-vitro data suggest that letermovir may possess low genetic barrier to resistance. In prophylaxis trials, two breakthrough infections were reported due to selection of CMV UL56 V236M mutation. SUMMARY: Letermovir is an important addition to the current strategies for CMV prevention after allogeneic HSCT. Its favourable efficacy and safety profile re-opens door for antiviral prophylaxis another first-line option, similar to CMV surveillance-preemptive therapy, for preventing CMV in allogeneic HSCT recipients.",

Faithful chromosome segregation and genome maintenance requires the removal of all DNA bridges that physically link chromosomes before cells divide. Using C. elegans embryos we show that the LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease defines a previously undescribed genome integrity mechanism by processing DNA bridges right before cells divide. LEM-3 acts at the midbody, the structure where abscission occurs at the end of cytokinesis. LEM-3 localization depends on factors needed for midbody assembly, and LEM-3 accumulation is increased and prolonged when chromatin bridges are trapped at the cleavage plane. LEM-3 locally processes chromatin bridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombination intermediates, or the perturbance of chromosome structure. Proper LEM-3 midbody localization and function is regulated by AIR-2/Aurora B kinase. Strikingly, LEM-3 acts cooperatively with the BRC-1/BRCA1 homologous recombination factor to promote genome integrity. These findings provide a molecular basis for the suspected role of the LEM-3 orthologue Ankle1 in human breast cancer.",

Homologous recombination is essential for crossover (CO) formation and accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. It is of considerable importance to work out how recombination intermediates are processed, leading to CO and non-crossover (NCO) outcome. Genetic analysis in budding yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans indicates that the processing of meiotic recombination intermediates involves a combination of nucleases and DNA repair enzymes. We previously reported that in C. elegans meiotic joint molecule resolution is mediated by two redundant pathways, conferred by the SLX-1 and MUS-81 nucleases, and by the HIM-6 Bloom helicase in conjunction with the XPF-1 endonuclease, respectively. Both pathways require the scaffold protein SLX-4. However, in the absence of all these enzymes, residual processing of meiotic recombination intermediates still occurs and CO formation is reduced but not abolished. Here we show that the LEM-3 nuclease, mutation of which by itself does not have an overt meiotic phenotype, genetically interacts with slx-1 and mus-81 mutants, the respective double mutants displaying 100% embryonic lethality. The combined loss of LEM-3 and MUS-81 leads to altered processing of recombination intermediates, a delayed disassembly of foci associated with CO designated sites, and the formation of univalents linked by SPO-11 dependent chromatin bridges (dissociated bivalents). However, LEM-3 foci do not colocalize with ZHP-3, a marker that congresses into CO designated sites. In addition, neither CO frequency nor distribution is altered in lem-3 single mutants or in combination with mus-81 or slx-4 mutations. Finally, we found persistent chromatin bridges during meiotic divisions in lem-3; slx-4 double mutants. Supported by the localization of LEM-3 between dividing meiotic nuclei, this data suggest that LEM-3 is able to process erroneous recombination intermediates that persist into the second meiotic division.",

UNLABELLED: UPDtool is a computational tool for detection and classification of uniparental disomy (UPD) in trio SNP-microarray experiments. UPDs are rare events of chromosomal malsegregation and describe the condition of two homologous chromosomes or homologous chromosomal segments that were inherited from one parent. The occurrence of UPD can be of major clinical relevance. Though high-throughput molecular screening techniques are widely used, detection of UPDs and especially the subclassification remains complex. We developed UPDtool to detect and classify UPDs from SNP microarray data of parent-child trios. The algorithm was tested using five positive controls including both iso- and heterodisomic segmental UPDs and 30 trios from the HapMap project as negative controls. With UPDtool, we were able to correctly identify all occurrences of non-mosaic UPD within our positive controls, whereas no occurrence of UPD was found within our negative controls. In addition, the chromosomal breakage points could be determined more precisely than by microsatellite analysis. Our results were compared with both the gold standard, microsatellite analysis and SNPtrio, another program available for UPD detection. UPDtool is platform independent, light weight and flexible. Because of its simple input format, UPDtool may also be used with other high-throughput technologies (e.g., next-generation sequencing).

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH), either with or without accompanying copy-number loss, is a cardinal feature of cancer genomes that is tightly linked to cancer development. However, detection of LOH is frequently hampered by the presence of normal cell components within tumor specimens and the limitation in availability of constitutive DNA. Here, we describe a simple but highly sensitive method for genomewide detection of allelic composition, based on the Affymetrix single-nucleotide-polymorphism genotyping microarray platform, without dependence on the availability of constitutive DNA. By sensing subtle distortions in allele-specific signals caused by allelic imbalance with the use of anonymous controls, sensitive detection of LOH is enabled with accurate determination of allele-specific copy numbers, even in the presence of up to 70%-80% normal cell contamination. The performance of the new algorithm, called \"AsCNAR\" (allele-specific copy-number analysis using anonymous references), was demonstrated by detecting the copy-number neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy (UPD), in a large number of acute leukemia samples. We next applied this technique to detection of UPD involving the 9p arm in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), which is tightly associated with a homozygous JAK2 mutation. It revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of 9p UPD that otherwise would have been undetected and also disclosed the existence of multiple subpopulations having distinct 9p UPD within the same MPD specimen. In conclusion, AsCNAR should substantially improve our ability to dissect the complexity of cancer genomes and should contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of human cancers.",

Motivation: Despite significant efforts in expert curation, clinical relevance about most of the 154 million dbSNP reference variants (RS) remains unknown. However, a wealth of knowledge about the variant biological function/disease impact is buried in unstructured literature data. Previous studies have attempted to harvest and unlock such information with text-mining techniques but are of limited use because their mutation extraction results are not standardized or integrated with curated data. Results: We propose an automatic method to extract and normalize variant mentions to unique identifiers (dbSNP RSIDs). Our method, in benchmarking results, demonstrates a high F-measure of \u223c90% and compared favorably to the state of the art. Next, we applied our approach to the entire PubMed and validated the results by verifying that each extracted variant-gene pair matched the dbSNP annotation based on mapped genomic position, and by analyzing variants curated in ClinVar. We then determined which text-mined variants and genes constituted novel discoveries. Our analysis reveals 41 889 RS numbers (associated with 9151 genes) not found in ClinVar. Moreover, we obtained a rich set worth further review: 12 462 rare variants (MAF < 0.01) in 3849 genes which are presumed to be deleterious and not frequently found in the general population. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to analyze and integrate text-mined variant data with curated knowledge in existing databases. Our results suggest that databases can be significantly enriched by text mining and that the combined information can greatly assist human efforts in evaluating/prioritizing variants in genomic research.

Resistance to currently available targeted therapies significantly hampers the survival of patients with prostate cancer with bone metastasis. Here we demonstrate an important resistance mechanism initiated from tumor-induced bone. Studies using an osteogenic patient-derived xenograft, MDA-PCa-118b, revealed that tumor cells resistant to cabozantinib, a Met and VEGFR-2 inhibitor, reside in a \"resistance niche\" adjacent to prostate cancer-induced bone. We performed secretome analysis of the conditioned medium from tumor-induced bone to identify proteins (termed \"osteocrines\") found within this resistance niche. In accordance with previous reports demonstrating that activation of integrin signaling pathways confers therapeutic resistance, 27 of the 90 osteocrines identified were integrin ligands. We found that following cabozantinib treatment, only tumor cells positioned adjacent to the newly formed woven bone remained viable and expressed high levels of pFAK-Y397 and pTalin-S425, mediators of integrin signaling. Accordingly, treatment of C4-2B4 cells with integrin ligands resulted in increased pFAK-Y397 expression and cell survival, whereas targeting integrins with FAK inhibitors PF-562271 or defactinib inhibited FAK phosphorylation and reduced the survival of PC3-mm2 cells. Moreover, treatment of MDA-PCa-118b tumors with PF-562271 led to decreased tumor growth, irrespective of initial tumor size. Finally, we show that upon treatment cessation, the combination of PF-562271 and cabozantinib delayed tumor recurrence in contrast to cabozantinib treatment alone.

This phase I dose-escalation study was conducted in patients with advanced solid malignancies. METHODS: Using a traditional 3 + 3 design, VS-6063 was administered orally twice daily (b.i.d.) in 21-day cycles to cohorts of three to six patients. In cycle 1, a lead-in dose was administered to assess single-dose pharmacokinetics; steady-state pharmacokinetics was assessed after 15 days of continuous dosing. Dose escalation was performed in the fasted state, and repeated in two additional cohorts in the fed state. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were treated across nine dose levels (12.5-750 mg b.i.d.). Dose-limiting toxicities, comprising headache (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1) and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (n = 3), occurred at the 300- or 425-mg b.i.d. dose level and were reversible. Frequent adverse events included nausea (37 %), fatigue (33 %), vomiting (28 %), diarrhea (22 %) and headache (22 %). A maximum-tolerated dose was not defined. Dose escalation was stopped at the 750-mg b.i.d. dose due to decreased serum exposure in the 500- and 750-mg versus 300- and 425-mg groups. Food delayed the time to peak serum concentration without affecting serum drug exposure. No radiographic responses were reported. Disease stabilization at ~12 weeks occurred in six of 37 (16 %) patients receiving doses > 100 mg b.i.d. CONCLUSIONS: VS-6063 has an acceptable safety profile.

BACKGROUND: Docetaxel, the standard chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) also enhances the survival of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) when combined with androgen-deprivation therapy. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) activation is a mediator of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the second generation FAK inhibitor VS-6063 on docetaxel efficacy in pre-clinical CRPC and CSPC models. METHODS: Docetaxel-resistant CRPC cells, mice with PC3 xenografts, and ex vivo cultures of patient-derived primary prostate tumors were treated with VS-6063 and/or docetaxel, or vehicle control. Cell counting, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry techniques were used to evaluate the treatment effects. RESULTS: Docetaxel and VS-6063 co-treatment caused a greater decrease in the viability of docetaxel-resistant CRPC cells, and a greater inhibition in PC3 xenograft growth compared to either monotherapy. FAK expression in human primary prostate cancer was positively associated with advanced tumor stage. Patient-derived prostate tumor explants cultured with both docetaxel and VS-6063 displayed a higher percentage of apoptosis in cancer cells, than monotherapy treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that co-administration of the FAK inhibitor, VS-6063, with docetaxel represents a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.",

PURPOSE: VS-6063 (also known as defactinib or PF-04554878) is a second-generation inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase and proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2. This phase 1 study evaluated the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of VS-6063 in Japanese subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies in a first-in-Asian study setting. METHODS: VS-6063 was administered orally twice daily (b.i.d.) in 21-day cycles to cohorts of three subjects each with a standard 3\u00a0+\u00a03 dose-escalation design until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected on Day 1 and 15. The assessments were performed using CTCAE v4.0 for adverse events (AEs), and the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, version v1.1 (RECIST v1.1) for tumor response. RESULTS: Nine patients were treated across three dose levels (200-600\u00a0mg BID). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at any dose level. Most frequent treatment-related AEs were Grade 1/2 unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, fatigue, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Only one subject in the 200\u00a0mg BID cohort experienced reversible and transient Grade 3 unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. PK analyses confirmed that the exposure at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 400\u00a0mg BID was comparable with exposures previously reported in non-Japanese subjects. Durable stable disease of approximately 24\u00a0weeks was confirmed in two subjects (malignant mesothelioma and rectal cancer). CONCLUSIONS: VS-6063 was well tolerated at all dose levels investigated in this first-in-Asian study. These data support the administration of VS-6063 to Japanese subjects at the RP2D in clinical trials involving solid tumor malignancies.",

Squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC) accounts for 30% of patients with NSCLC and to date, no molecular targeted agents are approved for this type of tumor. However, recent studies have revealed several oncogenic mutations in SCC patients, including an alteration of the PI3K/AKT pathway, i.e. PI3K point mutations and amplification, AKT mutations and loss or reduced PTEN expression. Prompted by our observation of a correlation between PTEN loss and FAK phosphorylation in a cohort of patients with stage IV SCC, we evaluated the relevance of PTEN loss in cancer progression as well as the efficacy of a new combined treatment with the pan PI3K inhibitor buparlisip and the FAK inhibitor defactinib. An increase in AKT and FAK phosphorylation, associated with increased proliferation and invasiveness, paralleled by the acquisition of mesenchymal markers, and overexpression of the oncomir miR-21 were observed in SKMES-1-derived cell clones with a stable reduction of PTEN. Notably, the combined treatment induced a synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation, and a significant reduction in cell migration and invasion only in cells with reduced PTEN. The molecular mechanisms underlying these findings were unraveled using a specific RTK array that showed a reduction in phosphorylation of key kinases such as JNK, GSK-3 \u03b1/\u03b2, and AMPK-\u03b12, due to the concomitant decrease in AKT and FAK activation. In conclusion, the combination of buparlisib and defactinib was effective against cells with reduced PTEN and warrants further studies as a novel therapeutic strategy for stage IV SCC patients with loss of PTEN expression.",

BACKGROUND: Orofacial granulomatosis is a relatively recent term coined by Wiesenfield et al. in 1985 to define granulomatous lesions of oral mucosa without intestinal involvement. When it presents in a triad encompassing facial nerve palsy, lip swelling, and fissured or furrowed tongue it is called Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome while monosymptomatic or oligosymptomatic forms are referred to as granulomatous cheilitis. It is an uncommon clinicopathologic entity which is distinct from classic Crohn's disease. The NOD2 variant which is commonly associated with Crohn's has not been shown to have any association with orofacial granulomatosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 31-year-old white man who had painful swelling of the lip with oral ulcers and difficulty eating for 2 to 3\u00a0years. He was diagnosed as having granulomatous cheilitis based on characteristic biopsy findings. There was serologic evidence of Crohn's disease with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies. However, he was not found to have any gastrointestinal involvement based on computed tomography enterography, and upper and lower endoscopies. He failed to respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and dapsone therapy but responded well to high doses of infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Our case questions whether granulomatous cheilitis really exists or is it simply a variant of Crohn's disease with only oral presentation. Our patient did not have symptoms of Crohn's disease; moreover, endoscopic studies and computed tomography enterography were unremarkable for evidence of intestinal involvement. Our case is also the first reported case where high-dose infliximab alone has been used with sustained response for approximately 8\u00a0months. In conclusion, more research is needed to assess the underlying pathology as well as ideal treatment options for patients with orofacial granulomatosis. We propose that high-dose infliximab should be considered in patients who do not respond to traditional therapies.",

In the current literature confusing heterogeneity exists, mixing together the historically grown terms cheilitis granulomatosa or granulomatous cheilitis, Melkersson Rosenthal syndrome and the umbrella term Orofacial Granulomatosis (OFG). METHODS: We provide a systematic review comprising all three disease entities of orofacial granulomatosis using the computerized database \"Pubmed Medline\" entering the keywords \"orofacial granulomatosis\" (141 references), \"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome\" (207 references), \"granulomatous cheilitis\" or \"cheilitis granulomatosa\" (102 references) back to 1956. Full-text journals and case studies were included, and data synthesis was performed individually. RESULTS: Etiology remains unclear for all three disease entities. Etiological relatedness to chronic inflammatory bowel disease is under discussion and effectiveness was found for different treatments, e.g. local triamcinolone injections, antibiotics, surgical interventions, TNF alpha blockers or exclusive enteral nutrition. No randomized controlled trial concerning the therapy of orofacial granulomatosis was found. As a consequence, the therapeutic conclusion is drawn mainly from small case series, thus limiting the evidence of therapeutic interventions. CONCLUSION: OFG with the sub-entities MRS and cheilitis granulomatosa is an etiological obscure disease process with various possible therapeutic interventions potentially alleviating the disease course but to broaden treatment knowledge further study in randomized controlled trials is needed.",

Motivation: Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the differential abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can comprise the majority (>85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation. Results: Methods that align RNA-seq reads to a diploid transcriptome incorporating known genetic variants improve estimates of ASE and total gene expression compared to methods that use reference genome alignments. Weighted allocation methods outperform methods that discard multi-reads. Hierarchical allocation of reads improves estimation of ASE even when data are simulated from a non-hierarchical model. Analysis of RNA-seq data from F1 hybrid mice using EMASE reveals widespread ASE associated with cis-acting polymorphisms and a small number of parent-of-origin effects.

The Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines for HIV recommend many of these integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) STRs as a preferred choice for initiation of treatment in both ART-naive and -experienced patients because they offer comparably faster rates of virologic suppression, reduced rates of resistance development (especially with DTG), and overall better adherence than protease inhibitors or NNRTIs. Numerous phase 3 clinical trials support these recommendations including several switch or simplification clinical trials. Notably, the novel pharmacokinetic booster COBI, with its water soluble properties, has enabled the development and coformulation of a few of these STRs and FDCs. Also, a newer tenofovir salt formulation, TAF, has an advantageous pharmacokinetic profile, contributing to better overall renal and bone tolerability compared with TDF. Further simplification regimens comprising dual ART therapies are currently being explored. This review provides an overview of the clinical efficacy and safety data for these coformulated agents, highlighting the relative impact on comparative adverse events, assessing the potential for experiencing fewer drug-drug interactions, and discussing the clinical implications regarding adherence to treatment.",

Background: If HIV patients are unconscious or cannot swallow tablets for other reasons, antiretroviral medication is crushed and dissolved prior to administration. Crushing can alter drug exposure, possibly leading to treatment failure, development of resistance or toxicity. Currently, there is no information about crushing of the branded fixed-dose combination of dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (Triumeq\u00ae, referred to as TRI); therefore, crushing of TRI is not recommended. Objectives: To investigate whether the TRI fixed-dose combination tablet can be crushed and combined with enteral nutrition without influencing pharmacokinetics (PK). Methods: We carried out an open-label, three-period, randomized, single-dose, crossover trial in 22 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects randomly received whole-tablet TRI with fasting (reference), crushed and suspended TRI with fasting or crushed and suspended TRI with oral intake of enteral nutrition. Bioequivalence criteria (80%-125% acceptance range) of AUC0-\u221e and Cmax were used. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02569346. Results: Crushing TRI leads to higher dolutegravir exposure (AUC0-\u221e: +26% and Cmax: +30%) and, if crushed TRI is combined with enteral nutrition, to a decrease in abacavir Cmax (-17%). Lamivudine concentrations were not affected as geometric mean ratios with 90% CIs fell within the 80%-125% range. Conclusions: Bioequivalence could not be demonstrated for a crushed and suspended tablet or a crushed and suspended tablet with oral intake of enteral nutrition compared with whole-tablet TRI with fasting. Both scenarios led to higher dolutegravir exposure, but this did not exceed exposure after intake with food or in twice-daily dosing. In our opinion, TRI can be crushed for patients with swallowing difficulties and can be simultaneously administered with enteral nutrition.",

In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk.

Objective: To investigate whether a totally intracorporeally radical cystectomy (RC) can be considered the new 'gold standard' in bladder cancer, as open RC (ORC) is the current 'gold standard' for surgical treatment of muscle-invasive and high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is becoming the preferred surgical approach in many centres as it seems to maintain the oncological control of open surgery whilst offering improved perioperative benefits. Materials and methods: A review of the literature was conducted using the Pubmed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge and Cochrane Databases to identify studies that included both ORC and RARC with intracorporeal and extracorporeal urinary diversion (UD) published up to July 2017. Results: Evidence from four single-centre randomised controlled trials and now the multicentre Randomized Trial of Open versus Robotic Cystectomy (RAZOR) trial demonstrate the oncological equivalence of RARC to ORC. The only convincing evidence for the superiority of RARC is in the area of blood loss and transfusion rates. However, the UD procedure in these trials was performed extracorporeally and, to realise the full benefits of RARC, a totally intracorporeal approach is needed. Intracorporeal UDs (ICUDs) have been shown to be technically feasible by a few expert centres and have demonstrated some improved short-term perioperative outcomes compared to extracorporeal UDs. Conclusions: Although initial outcomes appear promising, RARC with ICUD is far from gaining 'gold standard' status. Further studies are needed to confirm that outcomes are reproducible widely. Furthermore, the benefits of a totally intracorporeal approach must be confirmed in randomised controlled trials.",

BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy is the surgical standard for invasive bladder cancer. Robot-assisted cystectomy has been proposed to provide similar oncological outcomes with lower morbidity. We aimed to compare progression-free survival in patients with bladder cancer treated with open cystectomy and robot-assisted cystectomy. METHODS: The RAZOR study is a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial done in 15 medical centres in the USA. Eligible participants (aged > 18 years) had biopsy-proven clinical stage T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer or refractory carcinoma in situ. Individuals who had previously had open abdominal or pelvic surgery, or who had any pre-existing health conditions that would preclude safe initiation or maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were excluded. Patients were centrally assigned (1:1) via a web-based system, with block randomisation by institution, stratified by type of urinary diversion, clinical T stage, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, to receive robot-assisted radical cystectomy or open radical cystectomy with extracorporeal urinary diversion. Treatment allocation was only masked from pathologists. The primary endpoint was 2-year progression-free survival, with non-inferiority established if the lower bound of the one-sided 97\u00b75% CI for the treatment difference (robotic cystectomy minus open cystectomy) was greater than -15 percentage points. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population. Safety was assessed in the same population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01157676. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2011, and Nov 18, 2014, 350 participants were randomly assigned to treatment. The intended treatment was robotic cystectomy in 176 patients and open cystectomy in 174 patients. 17 (10%) of 176 patients in the robotic cystectomy group did not have surgery and nine (5%) patients had a different surgery to that they were assigned. 21 (12%) of 174 patients in the open cystectomy group did not have surgery and one (1%) patient had robotic cystectomy instead of open cystectomy. Thus, 302 patients (150 in the robotic cystectomy group and 152 in the open cystectomy group) were included in the per-protocol analysis set. 2-year progression-free survival was 72\u00b73% (95% CI 64\u00b73 to 78\u00b78) in the robotic cystectomy group and 71\u00b76% (95% CI 63\u00b76 to 78\u00b72) in the open cystectomy group (difference 0\u00b77%, 95% CI -9\u00b76% to 10\u00b79%; p=0\u00b7001), indicating non-inferiority of robotic cystectomy. Adverse events occurred in 101 (67%) of 150 patients in the robotic cystectomy group and 105 (69%) of 152 patients in the open cystectomy group. The most common adverse events were urinary tract infection (53 [35%] in the robotic cystectomy group vs 39 [26%] in the open cystectomy group) and postoperative ileus (33 [22%] in the robotic cystectomy group vs 31 [20%] in the open cystectomy group). INTERPRETATION: In patients with bladder cancer, robotic cystectomy was non-inferior to open cystectomy for 2-year progression-free survival. Increased adoption of robotic surgery in clinical practice should lead to future randomised trials to assess the true value of this surgical approach in patients with other cancer types.

PURPOSE: Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI; TAS-102, Lonsurf\u00ae), a novel form of chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), has shown clinical benefit in the global, phase III RECOURSE trial, regardless of patient age. Here, we report the safety and tolerability profile of FTD/TPI from an expanded-access program (EAP) in the US patients with mCRC whose disease has progressed on the standard therapies. METHODS: A total of 549 patients ( > 18\u00a0years) with histologically confirmed mCRC following two or more regimens of standard therapy and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 participated in this open-label EAP. During the 28-day treatment cycle, patients took FTD/TPI 35\u00a0mg/m twice daily for 5\u00a0days followed by 2\u00a0days of rest for 2 weeks, with a 14-day rest period. Data were collected for therapy duration, treatment discontinuation, and adverse events. Age-based post hoc analysis was performed to determine the safety of FTD/TPI in elderly ( > 65\u00a0years) versus younger (< 65\u00a0years) patients. RESULTS: FTD/TPI-treated patients in this EAP had a similar therapy duration and time to treatment discontinuation to those in the RECOURSE trial. The safety profile in elderly patients was consistent with that in younger patients, with no unexpected safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This USA-based, open-label EAP has confirmed a similar safety and tolerability profile for FTD/TPI to that observed in the RECOURSE trial. Furthermore, FTD/TPI is well tolerated and can be considered as a treatment option in elderly patients with mCRC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02286492.",

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Servier, the company manufacturing trifluridine and tipiracil (T/T; trade name: Lonsurf), to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of T/T compared with best supportive care (BSC) for metastatic colorectal cancer (third-line or later). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents a summary of the company's submission (CS), the ERG report and the development of the NICE guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the appraisal committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of T/T based upon the CS. In the CS, pooled evidence of two trials (a phase II trial and RECOURSE) showed that T/T resulted in a significant increase in overall survival [OS; hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.78] and progression-free survival (PFS; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.40-0.53). The AC considered the survival benefit of T/T clinically meaningful although relatively small. The ERG highlighted that none of the participants in the phase II trial and approximately half of the RECOURSE participants (394 of 800) were from Europe, which might limit the applicability of the study findings to the NHS. Moreover, the ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns that resulted in 11 adjustments to the company's base-case analysis. The ERG adjustments that had the largest impact were using the RECOURSE trial data only (instead of the pooled evidence), fixing errors and violations and using the utilities from the CORRECT trial (identified in the literature review) only. The ERG preferred to use the RECOURSE trial data only given the suboptimal methodology used by the company to pool the evidence. However, since there were no fundamental arguments to prevent the two trials from being pooled, the ERG also presented its base-case analysis based on the pooled effectiveness estimates. The company base-case resulted in an incremental cost\u00a0effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a344,032 per QALY gained while the ERG base-case resulted in ICERs of \u00a352,695 and \u00a349,392 per QALY gained based on the RECOURSE trial only and pooled evidence, respectively. Since the AC concluded that the most plausible ICER was \u00a349,392 per QALY gained, and that T/T meets end-of-life criteria, T/T was recommended as a cost\u00a0effective use of NHS resources.",

BACKGROUND: Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102, Lonsurf\u00ae), a novel oral anti-tumor agent combining an anti-neoplastic thymidine-based nucleoside analogue (trifluridine, FTD) with a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (tipiracil hydrochloride, TPI) presents a new treatment option for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients refractory or intolerant to standard therapies. FTD/TPI was approved in the European Union (EU) in April 2016 and launched on the German market in August 15, 2016. METHODS: We investigated the characteristics of patients (pts) with mCRC treated with FTD/TPI at 118 centers in Germany from January 12 to August 14, 2016 and analyzed the safety in a clinical real-world setting. RESULTS: In Germany, a total of 226 mCRC patients were included into a compassionate-use-program (CUP) and received FTD/TPI. For 45.5% of patients (n = 101), 253 adverse events (AE) were documented, most of them drug-related (n = 135). From January 12 (2016) to March 2 (2017), 124 serious adverse events (SAE) were reported (74 drug related). The most common serious adverse drug reactions (SADR) were leukopenia (12 events), neutropenia (8 events), anemia (7 events), diarrhea and nausea (5 events each) (observation period January 12 2016 to October 7 2016). In total, 122 patients (54%) discontinued FTD/TPI treatment, mostly due to progression (n = 75) followed by AEs (n = 21), deaths (n = 16), and non-specified reasons (n = 16). Interestingly, 12 patients with ECOG PS > 2 achieved up to 3 cycles of FTD/TPI and in this patient population only 3 treatment discontinuations due to AEs were documented and the safety profile was comparable to the entire population.

The PI 3-kinases (PI3K) are essential mediators of chemokine receptor signaling necessary for migration of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and their interaction with tissue-resident stromal cells. While the PI3K\u03b4-specific inhibitor idelalisib shows efficacy in treatment of CLL and other B cell malignancies, the function of PI3K\u03b3 has not been extensively studied in B cells. Here, we assess whether PI3K\u03b3 has non-redundant functions in CLL migration and adhesion to stromal cells. We observed that pharmaceutical PI3K\u03b3 inhibition with CZC24832 significantly impaired CLL\u00a0cell migration, while dual PI3K\u03b4/\u03b3 inhibitor duvelisib had a greater impact than single isoform-selective inhibitors. Knockdown of PI3K\u03b3 reduced migration of CLL cells and cell lines. Expression of the PI3K\u03b3 subunits increased in CLL cells in response to CD40L/IL-4, whereas BCR cross-linking had no effect. Overexpression of PI3K\u03b3 subunits enhanced cell migration in response to SDF1\u03b1/CXCL12, with the strongest effect observed within ZAP70 +\u00a0CLL samples. Microscopic tracking of cell migration within chemokine gradients revealed that PI3K\u03b3 functions in gradient sensing and impacts cell morphology and F-actin polarization. PI3K\u03b3 inhibition also reduced CLL adhesion to stromal cells to a similar extent as idelalisib. These findings provide the first evidence that PI3K\u03b3 has unique functions in malignant B cells.",

In a Phase 1, open-label study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical activity, and safety of duvelisib monotherapy in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, duvelisib was administered at eight dose levels (8-100 mg BID) in a dose-escalation phase (n = 31 evaluable patients). Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Grade 3 transaminase elevations and Grade 3 rash, occurred at 100 mg BID, and the MTD was determined to be 75 mg BID. Across all doses, 58.1% of iNHL patients had a response (19.4% complete, 35.5% partial, and 3.2% minor); median time to response was 1.84 months and duration of response was 16.9 months. Median progression-free survival was 14.7 months, and the probability of overall survival at 24 months was 71.7%. Severe (Grade > 3) adverse events included elevated liver enzymes (38.7%), diarrhea (25.8%), and neutropenia (29.0%). Three patients, all in the 75 mg BID cohort, experienced fatal AEs: E. coli sepsis, acute respiratory failure, and fungal pneumonia. No iNHL patients experienced Pneumocystis pneumonia. Duvelisib demonstrated favorable clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile in these high-risk, heavily pretreated, relapsed/refractory iNHL patients, with 25 mg BID selected for further clinical development.",

Duvelisib (IPI-145) is an oral inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-\u03b4/\u03b3 isoforms currently in clinical development. PI3K-\u03b4/\u03b3 inhibition may directly inhibit malignant T-cell growth, making duvelisib a promising candidate for patients with peripheral (PTCL) or cutaneous (CTCL) T-cell lymphoma. Inhibition of either isoform may also contribute to clinical responses by modulating nonmalignant immune cells. We investigated these dual effects in a TCL cohort from a phase 1, open-label study of duvelisib in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL (n = 16) and CTCL (n = 19), along with in vitro and in vivo models of TCL. The overall response rates in patients with PTCL and CTCL were 50.0% and 31.6%, respectively (P = .32). There were 3 complete responses, all among patients with PTCL. Activity was seen across a wide spectrum of subtypes. The most frequently observed grade 3 and 4 adverse events were transaminase increases (40% alanine aminotransferase, 17% aspartate aminotransferase), maculopapular rash (17%), and neutropenia (17%). Responders and nonresponders had markedly different changes in serum cytokine profiles induced by duvelisib. In vitro, duvelisib potently killed 3 of 4 TCL lines with constitutive phospho-AKT (pAKT) vs 0 of 7 lines lacking pAKT (P = .024) and exceeded cell killing by the PI3K-\u03b4-specific inhibitor idelalisib. Administration of duvelisib to mice engrafted with a PTCL patient-derived xenograft resulted in a shift among tumor-associated macrophages from the immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype to the inflammatory M1-like phenotype. In summary, duvelisib demonstrated promising clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile in relapsed/refractory TCL, as well as preclinical evidence of both tumor cell-autonomous and immune-mediated effects.

Duvelisib is an oral dual inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-\u03b4 (PI3K-\u03b4) and PI3K-\u03b3 in late-stage clinical development for hematologic malignancy treatment. This phase 1 study evaluated maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety of duvelisib in 210 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. In the dose escalation phase (n = 31), duvelisib 8 to 100 mg twice daily was administered, with MTD determined as 75 mg twice daily. In the expansion phase (n = 179), patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or T-cell lymphoma (TCL) were treated with 25 or 75 mg duvelisib twice daily continuously. Single-dose duvelisib was rapidly absorbed (time to maximum concentration, 1-2 hours), with a half-life of 5.2 to 10.9 hours. PD results showed inhibition of phospho-AKT (S473) in CLL tumor cells following a single dose and near-complete inhibition of CLL proliferation (Ki-67) by cycle 2. Clinical responses were seen across a range of doses and disease subtypes: iNHL overall response rate, 58% (n = 31) with 6 complete responses (CRs); relapsed/refractory CLL, 56% (n = 55) with 1 CR; peripheral TCL, 50% (n = 16) with 3 CR; and cutaneous TCL, 32% (n = 19).

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous oncogenic virus that is associated with B cell lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Previous studies have shown that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is activated in EBV-associated lymphomas and can be a novel therapeutic target. An oral dual inhibitor of PI3K\u03b3 and PI3K\u03b4, duvelisib, is in clinical trials for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. In this study, we evaluated how duvelisib affects the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and if it has antitumor effects in EBV-associated lymphoma cell lines. We found that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was activated in most of the B and T cell lymphoma cell lines tested. Additionally, duvelisib treatment inhibited cellular growth in the tested cell lines. Overall, B cell lines were more susceptible to duvelisib than T and NK cell lines in vitro regardless of EBV infection. However, the additional influence of duvelisib on the tumor microenvironment was not assessed. Duvelisib treatment induced both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in EBV-positive and -negative B cell lines, but not in T cell lines. Furthermore, duvelisib treatment reduced the expression of EBV lytic genes (BZLF1 and gp350/220) in EBV-positive B cell lines, suggesting that duvelisib suppresses the lytic cycle of EBV induced by B cell receptor signaling. However, duvelisib did not induce a remarkable change in the expression of EBV latent genes. These results may indicate that there is therapeutic potential for duvelisib administration in the treatment of EBV-associated B cell lymphomas and other B cell malignancies.",

The omnigenic model of complex disease stipulates that the majority of the heritability will be explained by the effects of common variation on genes in the periphery of core disease pathways. Rare variant associations, expected to explain far less of the heritability, may be enriched in core disease genes and thus will be instrumental in the understanding of complex disease pathogenesis and their potential therapeutic targets. Here, using complementary whole-exome sequencing, high-density imputation, and in vitro cellular assays, we identify candidate core genes in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using extreme-phenotype sampling, we sequenced the exomes of 30 SLE parent-affected-offspring trios and identified 14 genes with missense de novo mutations (DNM), none of which are within the >80 SLE susceptibility loci implicated through genome-wide association studies. In a follow-up cohort of 10, 995 individuals of matched European ancestry, we imputed genotype data to the density of the combined UK10K-1000 genomes Phase III reference panel across the 14 candidate genes. Gene-level analyses indicate three functional candidates: DNMT3A, PRKCD, and C1QTNF4. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (P = 0.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.0033). We further characterise the TNF-dependent functions of the third candidate gene C1QTNF4 on NF-\u03baB activation and apoptosis, which are inhibited by the p.His198Gln DNM. Our results identify three novel genes in SLE susceptibility and support extreme-phenotype sampling and DNM gene discovery to aid the search for core disease genes implicated through rare variation.",
