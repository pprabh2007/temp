Summary: Measuring the similarity of graphs is a fundamental step in the analysis of graph-structured data, which is omnipresent in computational biology. Graph kernels have been proposed as a powerful and efficient approach to this problem of graph comparison. Here we provide graphkernels, the first R and Python graph kernel libraries including baseline kernels such as label histogram based kernels, classic graph kernels such as random walk based kernels, and the state-of-the-art Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. The core of all graph kernels is implemented in C ++ for efficiency. Using the kernel matrices computed by the package, we can easily perform tasks such as classification, regression and clustering on graph-structured samples. Availability and implementation: The R and Python packages including source code are available at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=graphkernels and https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphkernels.

Summary: With the rapid development in next-generation sequencing, cost and time requirements for genomic sequencing are decreasing, enabling applications in many areas such as cancer research. Many tools have been developed to analyze genomic variation ranging from single nucleotide variants to whole chromosomal aberrations. As sequencing throughput increases, the number of variants called by such tools also grows. Often employed manual inspection of such calls is thus becoming a time-consuming procedure. We developed the Variant InsPector and Expert Rating tool (VIPER) to speed up this process by integrating the Integrative Genomics Viewer into a web application. Analysts can then quickly iterate through variants, apply filters and make decisions based on the generated images and variant metadata. VIPER was successfully employed in analyses with manual inspection of more than 10 000 calls.

Chemotherapy is one of the most important treatment modalities for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). On the basis of the results of two pivotal Phase III placebo-controlled studies, sorafenib is currently acknowledged worldwide as the standard therapeutic agent for advanced HCC. Following the introduction of sorafenib for the treatment of HCC, Phase III trials of numerous other agents as first-line or second-line chemotherapy have been conducted to determine if any of these agents might offer superior survival benefit to sorafenib. In 2016, a clear survival benefit of regorafenib over placebo was demonstrated in HCC patients showing disease progression after sorafenib treatment. A year later, in 2017, lenvatinib has been shown to be non-inferior to sorafenib, in terms of the overall survival, in chemo-na\u00efve patients with advanced HCC. More recently, promising outcomes have also been reported with new agents, such as nivolumab and cabozantinib. At present, various novel combination regimens including these agents are currently under development. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is frequently adopted for the treatment of locally advanced HCC in Japan, based on reports of high response rates and favorable long-term outcomes. Although some randomized controlled trials of HAIC plus sorafenib vs. sorafenib alone as first-line therapy have been conducted in patients with advanced HCC, no firm evidence of the superiority of one over the other has been established yet. In the future, demonstration of the survival advantage of HAIC and the recognition of HAIC as one of the standard treatments for patients with advanced HCC are expected.",

Aberrant c-Met activity has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting that c-Met inhibition may have therapeutic potential. However, clinical trials of nonselective kinase inhibitors with c-Met activity (tivantinib, cabozantinib, foretinib, and golvatinib) in patients with HCC have failed so far to demonstrate significant efficacy. This lack of observed efficacy is likely due to several factors, including trial design, lack of patient selection according to tumor c-Met status, and the prevalent off-target activity of these agents, which may indicate that c-Met inhibition is incomplete. In contrast, selective c-Met inhibitors (tepotinib, capmatinib) can be dosed at a level predicted to achieve complete inhibition of tumor c-Met activity. Moreover, results from early trials can be used to optimize the design of clinical trials of these agents. Preliminary results suggest that selective c-Met inhibitors have antitumor activity in HCC, with acceptable safety and tolerability in patients with Child-Pugh A liver function. Ongoing trials have been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of selective c-Met inhibition compared with standard therapy in patients with HCC that were selected based on tumor c-Met status. Thus, c-Met inhibition continues to be an active area of research in HCC, with well-designed trials in progress to investigate the benefit of selective c-Met inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib inhibits tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, MET, and AXL, which are implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and the development of resistance to sorafenib, the standard initial treatment for advanced disease. This randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial evaluated cabozantinib as compared with placebo in previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: A total of 707 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib (60 mg once daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients had received previous treatment with sorafenib, had disease progression after at least one systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, and may have received up to two previous systemic regimens for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were progression-free survival and the objective response rate. RESULTS: At the second planned interim analysis, the trial showed significantly longer overall survival with cabozantinib than with placebo. Median overall survival was 10.2 months with cabozantinib and 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P=0.005). Median progression-free survival was 5.2 months with cabozantinib and 1.9 months with placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.52; P<0.001), and the objective response rates were 4% and less than 1%, respectively (P=0.009). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 68% of patients in the cabozantinib group and in 36% in the placebo group. The most common high-grade events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (17% with cabozantinib vs. 0% with placebo), hypertension (16% vs. 2%), increased aspartate aminotransferase level (12% vs. 7%), fatigue (10% vs. 4%), and diarrhea (10% vs. 2%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo. The rate of high-grade adverse events in the cabozantinib group was approximately twice that observed in the placebo group.

Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are characterised by considerable phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity. Treating HCC and designing clinical trials are particularly challenging because co-existing liver disease, present in most patients, limits aggressive therapeutic options. Positive results in recent phase III clinical trials have confirmed the high value of anti-angiogenic therapies for HCC in both first (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second line (regorafenib and cabozantinib) treatment modalities. However, failure of several large randomised controlled clinical trials over the last 10 years underlines the necessity for innovative treatment strategies and implementation of translational findings to overcome the unmet clinical need. Furthermore, the promising results from novel immunotherapies are likely to complement the landscape of active compounds for HCC and will require a completely different approach to patients, as well as the development of prognostic/predictive biomarkers. Given our increasing understanding of the most abundant molecular alterations in HCC, effective enrichment of patients based on clinical and molecular biomarkers, as well as adaptive clinical trials, are now feasible and should be implemented. Herein, we aim to review important aspects of precision medicine approaches in HCC that might contribute to improving the molecular subclassification of patients in a clinical trial setting and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies.",

Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 play a key role in type 2 (T2) asthma. This article reviews the signaling pathway of IL-4 and IL-13 and highlights its targeted therapy in severe asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: Several clinical trials of biologics targeting the IL-4/IL-13 pathway have recently been completed. In patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma, targeting IL-13 alone with biologics including lebrikizumab and tralokinumab has not shown consistent reduction in asthma exacerbations. Simultaneous targeting of both IL-4 and IL-13 by blocking IL-4 receptor \u03b1 using dupilumab has yielded more consistent results in reducing asthma exacerbations and improving lung function, especially in patients with increased blood eosinophils. Other biomarkers of T2 inflammation such as exhaled nitric oxide and serum periostin may also predict response to biologics targeting the IL-4/IL-13 pathway. SUMMARY: No biologic targeting the IL-4/IL-13 pathway is currently available for treatment of asthma, but emerging data suggest that biologics targeting IL-4 and IL-13 together may benefit patients with T2 high asthma.

BACKGROUND: Dupilumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor \u03b1 monoclonal antibody that blocks both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling.

METHODS: We randomly assigned 1902 patients 12 years of age or older with uncontrolled asthma in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive add-on subcutaneous dupilumab at a dose of 200 or 300 mg every 2 weeks or matched-volume placebos for 52 weeks. The primary end points were the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations and the absolute change from baseline to week 12 in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) before bronchodilator use in the overall trial population. Secondary end points included the exacerbation rate and FEV in patients with a blood eosinophil count of 300 or more per cubic millimeter. Asthma control and dupilumab safety were also assessed. RESULTS: The annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations was 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.53) among patients assigned to 200 mg of dupilumab every 2 weeks and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.05) among those assigned to a matched placebo, for a 47.7% lower rate with dupilumab than with placebo (P<0.001); similar results were seen with the dupilumab dose of 300 mg every 2 weeks. At week 12, the FEV had increased by 0.32 liters in patients assigned to the lower dose of dupilumab (difference vs. matched placebo, 0.14 liters; P<0.001); similar results were seen with the higher dose. Among patients with a blood eosinophil count of 300 or more per cubic millimeter, the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations was 0.37 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.48) among those receiving lower-dose dupilumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.38) among those receiving a matched placebo (65.8% lower rate with dupilumab than with placebo; 95% CI, 52.0 to 75.6); similar results were observed with the higher dose. Blood eosinophilia occurred after the start of the intervention in 52 patients (4.1%) who received dupilumab as compared with 4 patients (0.6%) who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, patients who received dupilumab had significantly lower rates of severe asthma exacerbation than those who received placebo, as well as better lung function and asthma control.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite currently available treatments, many asthma patients remain inadequately controlled, but identifying distinct patient populations (phenotypes/endotypes) may optimize their management. This review discusses some of the controversies and opportunities for improved disease control in severe asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently approved anti-immunoglobulin E and anti-interleukin 5 biologics, which target specific pathways instead of using a 'one size fits all' strategy, are efficacious and well tolerated therapies for severe asthma. The appropriate use of these biologics, and of those in development (e.g., benralizumab and dupilumab), should be aided by further understanding of asthma phenotypes and endotypes, utilizing appropriate biomarkers.Oral corticosteroids are often added as maintenance therapy for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, but their use is associated with significant adverse effects and should be considered a last option. The true cost of this therapy, including the cost of morbidities associated with its use, remains to be determined.Severe asthma in pediatrics poses a unique opportunity for possible prevention strategies and the potential for primary prevention. Although several avenues for primary prevention are being explored and are out of the scope of this review, we focus our discussion on the use of omalizumab, which has been recently explored in clinical trials. SUMMARY: Appropriate use of biologics in severe asthma should be supported by further understanding of biomarkers predicting response to targeted therapy. Because of their association with significant adverse effects, add-on oral corticosteroids should be considered a last treatment option for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma.

BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, an anti-IL-4 receptor \u03b1 mAb, inhibits IL-4/IL-13 signaling, key drivers of type 2/T2 immune diseases (eg, atopic/allergic disease). In a pivotal, phase 2b study (NCT01854047), dupilumab reduced severe exacerbations, improved lung function and quality of life, and was generally well tolerated in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma despite using medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting \u03b22-agonists. OBJECTIVE: To examine dupilumab's effect on the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) total score and its allergic rhinitis (AR)-associated items in asthma patients with comorbid perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). METHODS: A post hoc analysis reporting data from the phase 2b study for the 200 and 300\u00a0mg every 2\u00a0week (q2w) doses under investigation in phase 3 (NCT02414854) was carried out.

Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can help identify CNVs, most analytical methods suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity, especially in regions of low mappability. To address this, we use PopSV, a CNV caller that relies on multiple samples to control for technical variation. We demonstrate that our calls are stable across different types of repeat-rich regions and validate the accuracy of our predictions using orthogonal approaches. Applying PopSV to 640 human genomes, we find that low-mappability regions are approximately 5\u00a0times more likely to harbor germline CNVs, in stark contrast to the nearly uniform distribution observed for somatic CNVs in 95 cancer genomes. In addition to known enrichments in segmental duplication and near centromeres and telomeres, we also report that CNVs are enriched in specific types of satellite and in some of the most recent families of transposable elements. Finally, using this comprehensive approach, we identify 3455 regions with recurrent CNVs that were missing from existing catalogs. In particular, we identify 347 genes with a novel exonic CNV in low-mappability regions, including 29 genes previously associated with disease.",

Verubecestat is an inhibitor of \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Synthetic route development involves diastereoselective transformations with a need for enantiomeric excess (ee) determination of each intermediate and final active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The analytical technical package of validated methods relies on enantioselective SFC and RPLC separations using multiple 3 and 5 \u03bcm coated polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases (CSPs) and mobile phases combinations. Evaluation of recently developed chiral columns revealed a single chiral selector (Teicoplanin) bonded to 2.7 \u03bcm core-shell particles using HPO in HO/ACN and triethylammonium acetate: methanol based eluents at different isocratic compositions allowed good enatioseparation of all verubecestat intermediates. EE determination of verubecestat is easily performed on NicoShell, another macrocyclic glycopeptide chiral selector bonded to 2.7 \u03bcm superficially porous particles.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques in the brain. A\u03b2 is produced from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) followed by \u03b3-secretase. Verubecestat is an oral BACE-1 inhibitor that reduces the A\u03b2 level in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 78-week trial to evaluate verubecestat at doses of 12 mg and 40 mg per day, as compared with placebo, in patients who had a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The coprimary outcomes were the change from baseline to week 78 in the score on the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog; scores range from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating worse dementia) and in the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory scale (ADCS-ADL; scores range from 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating worse function). RESULTS: A total of 1958 patients underwent randomization; 653 were randomly assigned to receive verubecestat at a dose of 12 mg per day (the 12-mg group), 652 to receive verubecestat at a dose of 40 mg per day (the 40-mg group), and 653 to receive matching placebo. The trial was terminated early for futility 50 months after onset, which was within 5 months before its scheduled completion, and after enrollment of the planned 1958 patients was complete. The estimated mean change from baseline to week 78 in the ADAS-cog score was 7.9 in the 12-mg group, 8.0 in the 40-mg group, and 7.7 in the placebo group (P=0.63 for the comparison between the 12-mg group and the placebo group and P=0.46 for the comparison between the 40-mg group and the placebo group). The estimated mean change from baseline to week 78 in the ADCS-ADL score was -8.4 in the 12-mg group, -8.2 in the 40-mg group, and -8.9 in the placebo group (P=0.49 for the comparison between the 12-mg group and the placebo group and P=0.32 for the comparison between the 40-mg group and the placebo group). Adverse events, including rash, falls and injuries, sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, weight loss, and hair-color change, were more common in the verubecestat groups than in the placebo group.

Although there has been considerable debate about whether paternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transmission may coexist with maternal transmission of mtDNA, it is generally believed that mitochondria and mtDNA are exclusively maternally inherited in humans. Here, we identified three unrelated multigeneration families with a high level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (ranging from 24 to 76%) in a total of 17 individuals. Heteroplasmy of mtDNA was independently examined by high-depth whole mtDNA sequencing analysis in our research laboratory and in two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratories using multiple approaches. A comprehensive exploration of mtDNA segregation in these families shows biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal dominantlike inheritance mode. Our results suggest that, although the central dogma of maternal inheritance of mtDNA remains valid, there are some exceptional cases where paternal mtDNA could be passed to the offspring. Elucidating the molecular mechanism for this unusual mode of inheritance will provide new insights into how mtDNA is passed on from parent to offspring and may even lead to the development of new avenues for the therapeutic treatment for pathogenic mtDNA transmission.",

High affinity of CEP-26401 for H\u2083R was demonstrated in radioligand binding displacement assays in rat brain membranes (K(i) = 2.7 \u00b1 0.3 nM) and recombinant rat and human H\u2083R-expressing systems (K(i) = 7.2 \u00b1 0.4 and 2.0 \u00b1 1.0 nM, respectively). CEP-26401 displayed potent antagonist and inverse agonist activities in [\u00b3\u2075S]guanosine 5'-O-(\u03b3-thio)triphosphate binding assays. After oral dosing of CEP-26401, occupancy of H\u2083R was estimated by the inhibition of ex vivo binding in rat cortical slices (OCC\u2085\u2080 = 0.1 \u00b1 0.003 mg/kg), and antagonism of the H\u2083R agonist R-\u03b1-methylhistamine- induced drinking response in the rat dipsogenia model was demonstrated in a similar dose range (ED\u2085\u2080 = 0.06 mg/kg). CEP-26401 improved performance in the rat social recognition model of short-term memory at doses of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg p.o. and was wake-promoting at 3 to 30 mg/kg p.o. In DBA/2NCrl mice, CEP-26401 at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p. increased prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p. Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and suggest that this novel H\u2083R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders.

Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation studies with single (0.02 to 5 mg) or multiple administration (0.02 to 0.5 mg once daily) of CEP-26401 were conducted in healthy subjects. Plasma and urine samples were collected to investigate CEP-26401 pharmacokinetics.

Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was conducted on one CANTAB and one polysomnography parameter of interest. CEP-26401 was slowly absorbed (median tmax range 3-6 hours) and the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 24-60 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved within six days of dosing. CEP-26401 exhibits dose- and time-independent pharmacokinetics, and renal excretion is a major elimination pathway. CEP-26401 had a dose-dependent negative effect on sleep, with some positive effects on certain CANTAB cognitive parameters seen at lower concentrations. The derived three compartment population pharmacokinetic model, with first-order absorption and elimination, accurately described the available pharmacokinetic data.

Fibrous cross-\u03b2 aggregates (amyloids) and their transmissible forms (prions) cause diseases in mammals (including humans) and control heritable traits in yeast. Initial nucleation of a yeast prion by transiently overproduced prion-forming protein or its (typically, QN-rich) prion domain is efficient only in the presence of another aggregated (in most cases, QN-rich) protein. Here, we demonstrate that a fusion of the prion domain of yeast protein Sup35 to some non-QN-rich mammalian proteins, associated with amyloid diseases, promotes nucleation of Sup35 prions in the absence of pre-existing aggregates. In contrast, both a fusion of the Sup35 prion domain to a multimeric non-amyloidogenic protein and the expression of a mammalian amyloidogenic protein that is not fused to the Sup35 prion domain failed to promote prion nucleation, further indicating that physical linkage of a mammalian amyloidogenic protein to the prion domain of a yeast protein is required for the nucleation of a yeast prion. Biochemical and cytological approaches confirmed the nucleation of protein aggregates in the yeast cell. Sequence alterations antagonizing or enhancing amyloidogenicity of human amyloid-\u03b2 (associated with Alzheimer's disease) and mouse prion protein (associated with prion diseases), respectively, antagonized or enhanced nucleation of a yeast prion by these proteins. The yeast-based prion nucleation assay, developed in our work, can be employed for mutational dissection of amyloidogenic proteins. We anticipate that it will aid in the identification of chemicals that influence initial amyloid nucleation and in searching for new amyloidogenic proteins in a variety of proteomes.",

In contrast to the functional prions, [Het-s] of Podospora anserina and [BETA] of yeast, the amyloid-based yeast prions are rare in wild strains, arise sporadically, have an array of prion variants for a single prion protein sequence, have a folded in-register parallel \u03b2-sheet amyloid architecture, are detrimental to their hosts, arouse a stress response in the host, and are subject to curing by various host anti-prion systems. These characteristics allow a logical basis for distinction between functional amyloids/prions and prion diseases. These infectious yeast amyloidoses are outstanding models for the many common human amyloid-based diseases that are increasingly found to have some infectious characteristics.",

Endogenous yeast amyloids that control heritable traits and are frequently used as models for human amyloid diseases are termed yeast prions. Yeast prions, including the best studied ones ([PSI ] and [URE3]), propagate via intimate interactions with molecular chaperones. Different yeast prions exhibit differential responses to changes in levels, functionality or localization of the components of chaperone machinery. Here, we provide additional data confirming differential effects of chaperones (and specifically, Hsp40s) on yeast prions and summarize current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying chaperone specificities. Contrary to frequent statements in literature, overproduction of the Hsp104 chaperone antagonizes both [PSI ] and [URE3] prions, while overproduction of the Hsp70-Ssa1 chaperone antagonizes [URE3] prion only in some, but not in all strains. Recently, we demonstrated that the relocalization of a fraction of the Hsp40 chaperone Sis1 from the cytosol to the nucleus by the chaperone-sorting factor Cur1 exhibits opposite effects on [PSI ] and [URE3] prions. We suggest that the response of prions to changes in Sis1 localization represents a combination of the effects of Sis1 shortage on fragmentation of prion aggregates and on malpartition of prion aggregates during a cell division. Differences in sensitivity of prion fragmentation to Sis1 and in relative inputs of fragmentation and malpartition in prion propagation result in opposite effects of Sis1 relocalization on [PSI ] and [URE3].",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The antiviral agent tenofovir is highly effective for the treatment of HIV and hepatitis B virus infections, and the older prodrug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is also a component of daily preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV infection in high-risk populations. Although TDF is well tolerated, the potential for kidney and bone toxicity has important implications for public health given the large number of individuals exposed to TDF worldwide. This review summarizes the recent literature on kidney and bone health in individuals treated with TDF and the newer prodrug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). RECENT FINDINGS: Risk factors for TDF toxicity appear to be similar in patients treated for HIV or hepatitis B virus and in HIV-uninfected PrEP users, although drug-drug interactions are a more important concern in HIV-positive individuals. The risk of toxicity appears to be lower with TAF, but further studies are needed to confirm the safety of long-term use and to evaluate the efficacy of TAF-based PrEP. SUMMARY: Nephrologists should be aware of the potential kidney and bone toxicity of TDF, as well as unique situations in which the newer prodrug TAF may contribute to kidney injury.",

OBJECTIVES: The National Health Service in England (NHS England) does not provide pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV, forcing people to purchase generic versions on the internet. However, there are concerns about the authenticity of medicines purchased online. We established an innovative service offering plasma tenofovir (TFV) and emcitrabine (FTC) therapeutic drug monitoring for people buying generic PrEP online, to ensure that drug concentrations in\u00a0vivo were consistent with those of propriety brands and previously published data. METHODS: TFV/FTC concentrations were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection. Evaluation of renal function and testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were also carried out, at baseline and every 3-6\u00a0months, with risk reduction advice. RESULTS: A total of 293 individuals presented having purchased PrEP on the internet: 85% were white, 84% were taking daily PrEP, and 16% were event-driven. Most were on generic TFV disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC from Cipla Ltd. Median (range) TFV and FTC plasma concentrations were 104 (21-597) ng/mL and 140 (17-1876) ng/mL, respectively. All concentrations were above our established plasma TFV and FTC targets, based on previously published data. Renal function was normal in all evaluable individuals and no new cases of HIV, HBV or HCV infection were seen. CONCLUSIONS: In a population at high risk of HIV acquisition, who cannot yet access PrEP on the NHS, concentrations of TFV and FTC in generic formulations purchased over the internet were similar to (or slightly higher than) those measured in phase I studies with the original formulation from Gilead (Truvada\u2122), which has demonstrated high levels of protection against HIV infection in previous PrEP clinical trials.",

Advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques now allow relatively easy and affordable sequencing of large portions of the genome, even for nonmodel organisms. Many phylogenetic studies reduce costs by focusing their sequencing efforts on a selected set of targeted loci, commonly enriched using sequence capture. The advantage of this approach is that it recovers a consistent set of loci, each with high sequencing depth, which leads to more confidence in the assembly of target sequences. High sequencing depth can also be used to identify phylogenetically informative allelic variation within sequenced individuals, but allele sequences are infrequently assembled in phylogenetic studies. Instead, many scientists perform their phylogenetic analyses using contig sequences which result from the de novo assembly of sequencing reads into contigs containing only canonical nucleobases, and this may reduce both statistical power and phylogenetic accuracy. Here, we develop an easy-to-use pipeline to recover allele sequences from sequence capture data, and we use simulated and empirical data to demonstrate the utility of integrating these allele sequences to analyses performed under the multispecies coalescent model. Our empirical analyses of ultraconserved element locus data collected from the South American hummingbird genus Topaza demonstrate that phased allele sequences carry sufficient phylogenetic information to infer the genetic structure, lineage divergence, and biogeographic history of a genus that diversified during the last 3 myr. The phylogenetic results support the recognition of two species and suggest a high rate of gene flow across large distances of rainforest habitats but rare admixture across the Amazon River. Our simulations provide evidence that analyzing allele sequences leads to more accurate estimates of tree topology and divergence times than the more common approach of using contig sequences.",

Hamsters fed with Du-zhong leaf extract for 10 weeks showed a smaller size of epididymal adipocytes compared to the control group. The supplementation of the Du-zhong leaf extract significantly lowered the plasma levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non HDL-cholesterol, and free fatty acid, whereas it elevated the HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio and apolipoprotein A-I levels. The hepatic cholesterol concentration was lower in the Du-zhong group than in the control group. The plasma total cholesterol concentration was positively correlated with hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity (r = 0.547, p < 0.05) and hepatic cholesterol concentration (r = 0.769, p < 0.001). The hepatic fatty acid synthase and HMG-CoA reductase activities were significantly lowered by a Du-zhong leaf extract supplement in high fat-fed hamsters. Hepatic fatty acid synthase activity was positively correlated with plasma fatty acid concentration (r = 0.513, p < 0.05) that was lower in the Du-zhong group.

Although proteasomal activity was not affected, lysosomal enzyme activities including V-ATPase were significantly increased by EUE as well as aucubin and geniposide in HepG2 cells. Treatment with the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin, reversed the inhibition of ER stress, secretion of apolipoprotein B, and hepatic lipid accumulation induced by EUE or its component, aucubin or geniposide. In addition, EUE was determined to regulate hepatic dyslipidemia by enhancing lysosomal activity and to regulate ER stress in rats fed a high-fat diet.

Objective: To assess whether at least 1 dose of galcanezumab was superior to placebo for episodic migraine prevention. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the United States (July 7, 2014, to August 19, 2015) in clinics of 37 licensed physicians with a specialty including, but not limited to, psychiatry, neurology, internal medicine, and primary care. Subcutaneous injections of galcanezumab, 5, 50, 120, or 300 mg, or placebo were given monthly during the 3-month treatment period. A total of 936 patients were assessed; 526 did not meet study entry or baseline criteria and 410 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or galcanezumab. Analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Interventions: Short-term migraine treatments were allowed as needed except for opioids or barbiturates. Main Outcomes and Measures: To determine if at least 1 of the 4 doses of galcanezumab tested was superior to placebo for migraine prevention measured by the mean change from baseline in the number of migraine headache days 9 weeks to 12 weeks after randomization. Results: Of the 936 patients assessed, 410 met entry criteria (aged 18-65 years with 4-14 migraine headache days per month and migraine onset prior to age 50 years) and were randomized to receive placebo or galcanezumab.

Adverse events reported by 5% or more of patients in at least 1 galcanezumab dose group and more frequently than placebo included injection-site pain, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, dysmenorrhea, and nausea. Conclusions and Relevance: Monthly subcutaneous injections of galcanezumab, both 120 mg and 300 mg, demonstrated efficacy (repeated-measures analysis) for the preventive treatment of migraine and support further development in larger phase 3 studies.

As reviewed in this article, all 4 antibodies have been proven effective, tolerable, and safe as migraine prophylactic treatments in phase II clinical trials. The mean decrease in migraine days per month was between 3.4 and 6.3\u00a0days/month after 8 to 12\u00a0weeks of treatment, and the placebo subtracted benefit ranged from 1 to 2.18\u00a0days.

Research has revealed a wide distribution of expression sites for calcitonin gene-related peptide in the central and peripheral nervous system. Of these, the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, which binds calcitonin gene-related peptide with high affinity, has attracted growing interest as a viable target for antimigraine therapies. An incentive to pursue such research is the continuing unmet medical need of patients. Triptans have offered some clinical benefit, but many patients do not respond and these drugs have important safety considerations. Initial calcitonin gene-related peptide-focused research led to development of the \"gepant\" small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blockers.

Upper respiratory tract infection (galcanezumab 10.0%; placebo 8.8%) and nasopharyngitis (galcanezumab 7.0%; placebo 2.2%) also occurred more frequently with galcanezumab treatment. Potential hypersensitivity events were reported at similar frequencies in galcanezumab (3.3%) and placebo (5.1%) groups. Incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies in galcanezumab dose groups (4.6% of patients during treatment period) did not appear to have any meaningful effects on safety, the pharmacokinetics of galcanezumab, or its ability to bind to the target ligand.

Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity has been shown to contribute to cellular dysfunction following traumatic brain injury (TBI).

The present experiment examined the effects of diazepam, a positive modulator at the GABA(A) receptor, on survival and cognitive performance in traumatically brain-injured animals. In experiment 1, 15 min prior to central fluid percussion brain injury, rats (n=8 per group) were injected (i.p.) with saline or diazepam (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg). Additional rats (n=8) were surgically prepared but not injured (sham-injury). Rats pre-treated with the 5 mg/kg dose of diazepam had significantly lower mortality (0%) than injured, saline-treated rats (53%). Also, diazepam-treated (5 mg/kg) rats had significantly shorter latencies to reach the goal platform in the Morris water maze test performed 11-15 days post-injury. In experiment 2, at 15 min post-injury, rats were given either saline (n=5) or 5 mg/kg diazepam (n=6). Rats treated with diazepam did not differ in mortality from injured rats treated with vehicle. However, rats treated with diazepam at 15 min post-injury had significantly shorter latencies to reach the goal platform in the Morris water maze than injured, vehicle-treated rats. In experiment 3, the post-injury administration of bicuculline (1.5 mg/kg, n=8), a GABA(A) antagonist, increased Morris water maze goal latencies compared to injured animals treated with saline (n=8).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine. METHODS: Adult patients with migraine were randomized (1:1:1) to a double-blind dose of oral lasmiditan 200 mg, lasmiditan 100 mg, or placebo and were asked to treat their next migraine attack within 4 hours of onset. Over 48 hours after dosing, patients used an electronic diary to record headache pain and the presence of nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia, one of which was designated their most bothersome symptom (MBS). RESULTS: Of the 1,856 patients who treated an attack, 77.9% had > 1 cardiovascular risk factors in addition to migraine. Compared with placebo, more patients dosed with lasmiditan 200 mg were free of headache pain at 2 hours after dosing (32.2% vs 15.3%; odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-3.6, p< 0.001), similar to those dosed with lasmiditan 100 mg (28.2%; OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.0, p< 0.001). Furthermore, compared with those dosed with placebo, more patients dosed with lasmiditan 200 mg (40.7% vs 29.5%; OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.1, p< 0.001) and lasmiditan 100 mg (40.9%; OR 1.7, 95% CI, 1.3-2.2, p< 0.001) were free of their MBS at 2 hours after dosing. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Lasmiditan dosed at 200 and 100 mg was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of acute migraine among patients with a high level of cardiovascular risk factors.

Migraine is an important socioeconomic burden and is ranked the sixth cause of years of life lost because of disability in the general population and the third cause of years of life lost in people younger than 50 years. The cornerstone of pharmacological treatment is represented by the acute therapy. The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptor subtype 1/1 agonists, called triptans, are nowadays the first-line acute therapy for patients who experience moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. Unfortunately, a high percentage of patients are not satisfied with this acute treatment, either for lack of response or side effects. Moreover, their mechanism of action based on vasoconstriction makes them unsuitable for patients with previous cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases and for those with uncontrolled hypertension. Since the introduction of triptans, no other acute drug class has passed all developmental stages. The research for a new drug lacking vasoconstrictive effects led to the development of lasmiditan, a highly selective 5-HT1 receptor agonist with minimized interactions with other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Lasmiditan is considered to be the first member of a new drug category, the neurally acting anti-migraine agent (NAAMA). Phase II and III trials had shown superiority compared to placebo and absence of typical triptan-associated adverse events (AEs). Most of the AEs were related to the central nervous system, depending on the high permeability through the blood-brain barrier and mild to moderate severity. The results of ongoing long-term Phase III trials will determine whether lasmiditan will become available in the market, and then active triptan comparator studies will assess patients' preference. Future studies could then explore the safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding or the risk that overuse of lasmiditan leads to medication overuse headache.",

Migraine is a common neurological disease characterised by the presence of attacks of unilateral, severe head pain accompanied by other symptoms. Although it has been classified as the sixth most disabling disorder, the available therapeutic options to treat this condition have not progressed accordingly. The advance in the development of 5-HT receptor agonists for migraine, including 5-HT and 5-HT receptor agonists, has meant a major step forward towards the progression of a better treatment for migraine. Triptans have a limited efficacy, and their effect on vasoconstriction makes them unsafe for patients with cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, novel effective antimigraine treatments without cardiovascular effects are required, such as selective 5-HT receptor agonists (ditans). Lasmiditan has much higher affinity for the 5-HT receptor than for the vasoconstrictor 5-HT receptor. This has been confirmed in preclinical studies performed to date, where lasmiditan showed no effect on vasoconstriction, and in clinical trials, where healthy individuals and patients did not report cardiac events due to treatment with lasmiditan, although it should be confirmed in larger cohorts. Lasmiditan crosses the blood-brain barrier and may act both centrally and peripherally on 5-HT receptors expressed on trigeminal neurons. It is a well-tolerated compound that does not induce major adverse events. Although ongoing phase III clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety, lasmiditan might offer an alternative to treat acute migraine with no associated cardiovascular risk. This review will focus on the characterisation of 5-HT receptor agonists and their effects as migraine therapies.",

Migraine is a neurovascular disorder that involves activation of the trigeminovascular system and cranial vasodilation mediated by release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The gold standard for acute migraine treatment are the triptans, 5-HT receptor agonists. Their actions are thought to be mediated through activation of: (i) 5-HT receptors in cranial blood vessels with subsequent cranial vasoconstriction; (ii) prejunctional 5-HT receptors on trigeminal fibers that inhibit trigeminal CGRP release; and (iii) 5-HT receptors in central nervous system involved in (anti)nociceptive modulation. Unfortunately, coronary arteries also express 5-HT receptors whose activation would produce coronary vasoconstriction; hence, triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease. In addition, since migraineurs have an increased cardiovascular risk, it is important to develop antimigraine drugs devoid of vascular (side) effects. Ditans, here defined as selective 5-HT receptor agonists, were developed on the basis that most of the triptans activate trigeminal 5-HT receptors, which may explain part of the triptans' antimigraine action. Amongst the ditans, lasmiditan: (i) fails to constrict human coronary arteries; and (ii) is effective for the acute treatment of migraine in preliminary Phase III clinical trials. Admittedly, the exact site of action is still unknown, but lasmiditan possess a high lipophilicity, which suggests a direct action on the central descending antinociceptive pathways. Furthermore, since 5-HT receptors are located on trigeminal fibers, they could modulate CGRP release. This review will be particularly focussed on the similarities and differences between the triptans and the ditans, their proposed sites of action, side effects and their cardiovascular risk profile.",

The transcription factor BCL11B is essential for development of the nervous and the immune system, and Bcl11b deficiency results in structural brain defects, reduced learning capacity, and impaired immune cell development in mice. However, the precise role of BCL11B in humans is largely unexplored, except for a single patient with a BCL11B missense mutation, affected by multisystem anomalies and profound immune deficiency. Using massively parallel sequencing we identified 13 patients bearing heterozygous germline alterations in BCL11B. Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. In addition, we suggest that missense mutations affecting specific sites within zinc-finger domains might result in distinct and more severe clinical outcomes.",

METHODS: Categorical efficacy and tolerability data were extracted from the clinical trial databases of the double-blind placebo-controlled studies of pimavanserin in persons with PDP. NNT and NNH values were calculated with their respective 95% confidence intervals. The likelihood to be helped or harmed (LHH) was then calculated contrasting therapeutic response versus discontinuation because of an adverse event. RESULTS: NNT values for pimavanserin 34 mg/d versus placebo for several definitions of clinical response are 10, and/or are not statistically significant, and/or show an advantage for pimavanserin over placebo (such as for postural hypotension). In terms of LHH, pimavanserin 34 mg/d is about five times more likely to result in clinical response (as measured by a > 3 point decrease from baseline on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms adapted for Parkinson's disease) versus discontinuation due to an adverse event.

Our previous study revealed that there might be the presence of extensive metabolites of pimavanserin in rats. However, the metabolic fate of pimavanserin in vivo remains unknown. Thus, it is essential to develop an efficient method to investigate the metabolic profile of pimavanserin in rats. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) to date has the highest mass measurement accuracy and resolution of any mass spectrometry platform. METHODS: After a single intragastric administration of pimavanserin at a dose of 50\u00a0mg kg , plasma, bile, urine and feces were collected from rats. A novel and efficient strategy was developed to analyze the metabolic profile of pimavanserin in vivo based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with FT-ICR-MS. RESULTS: A total of 23 metabolites were detected and tentatively identified through comparing their mass spectrometry profiles with those of pimavanserin. These metabolites were found in feces (22), bile (21), rat urine (16) and plasma (15). Results demonstrated that metabolic pathways of pimavanserin in rats included dehydrogenation, demethylation, deethylation, depropylation, debutylation, hydroxylation, dihydroxylation and trihydroxylation.

It analyzes the pharmacological, behavioral and molecular mechanisms of pimavanserin and their contribution to the therapeutic advantages of the drug as reported in published preclinical and clinical studies, press releases and product labels. Expert opinion: Pimavanserin exhibits a unique pharmacological profile with nanomolar affinity at serotonin 5-HT and 5-HT receptors. Functionally, it acts as a potent inverse agonist at 5-HT receptors, with selectivity over 5-HT receptors and no appreciable activity at other neurotransmitter receptors. Behavioral studies found that pimavanserin reversed impaired behaviors in animal models predictive of antipsychotic activity, and with no impairment of motor functions. The drug exhibits long plasma half-life (57 hours), which support its once/day administration.

The newest member of the A-I editing family of ADAR proteins, the vertebrate-specific ADAR3, is highly expressed in the brain, but its functional significance is unknown. In vitro studies have suggested that ADAR3 acts as a negative regulator of A-I RNA editing but the scope and underlying mechanisms are also unknown.

Consistent with this, we show that mice lacking exon 3 of Adar3 (which encodes two double stranded RNA binding domains) have increased levels of anxiety and deficits in hippocampus-dependent short- and long-term memory formation.

Standard treatments for advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) show significant side-effects and provide only short-term survival benefits due to disease recurrence. Thus, identification of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers is urgently needed. We have used 42 paraffin-embedded HGSOCs, to evaluate the utility of DNA copy number alterations, as potential predictors of clinical outcome. Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03-0.81; Padj = 0.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2-26 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life.",

Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main problem with checkpoint blockers is that only a fraction of patients respond to the therapy. Insufficient immune activation is considered as one of the main reason for low response rates and combination of checkpoint blockers has been proposed to increase the response rates. The combination of checkpoint blockers was successful in melanoma but had significant adverse events. A combination that is selected based on the mechanistic differences between checkpoints and the differences in expression of checkpoints and their ligands in the tumor microenvironment could have a synergistic effect in a given cancer subtype and also have a manageable safety profile. This review aims to help in design of optimal checkpoint blocker combinations by discussing the mechanistic details and outlining the subtle differences between major checkpoints targeted for cancer immunotherapy.",

          "context": "Durvalumab: an investigational anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma. Our expanding knowledge of immunotherapy for solid tumors has led to an explosion of clinical trials aimed at urothelial carcinoma. The primary strategy is centered on unleashing the immune system by releasing the inhibitory signals propagated by programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Many antibody constructs have been developed to block these interactions and are used in clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration has already approved a number of checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibodies including ipilimumab; anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies including nivolumab and pembrolizumab; anti-PD-L1 antibodies including atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab. One of the latest inhibitors is durvalumab, which is a high-affinity human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80. Currently, there are a number of ongoing trials in advanced urothelial carcinoma both using durvalumab monotherapy and in combination with other targeted therapies. In addition, durvalumab is being investigated in the non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, which is centered around intravenous formulations. These exciting developments have added a significant number of therapies in a previously limited treatment landscape.",

BACKGROUND: Avelumab has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the therapy of Merkel cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma. M7824 is a novel first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein comprising a monoclonal antibody against programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, avelumab), fused to the extracellular domain of human transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) receptor 2, which functions as a TGF\u03b2 \"trap.\" Advanced urothelial tumors have been shown to express TGF\u03b2, which possesses immunosuppressive properties that promote cancer progression and metastasis. The rationale for a combined molecule is to block the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction between tumor cells and immune cell infiltrate and simultaneously reduce or eliminate TGF\u03b2 from the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we explored the effect of M7824 on invasive urothelial carcinoma cell lines. METHODS: Human urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma cell lines HTB-4, HTB-1, and HTB-5 were treated with M7824, M7824mut (M7824 that is mutated in the anti-PD-L1 portion of the molecule and thus does not bind PD-L1), anti-PD-L1 (avelumab), or IgG1 isotype control monoclonal antibody, and were assessed for gene expression, cell-surface phenotype, and sensitivity to lysis by TRAIL, antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. RESULTS: M7824 retains the ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumor cells, although in some cases to a lesser extent than anti-PD-L1. However, compared to anti-PD-L1, M7824 increases (A) gene expression of molecules involved in T-cell trafficking in the tumor (e.g., CXCL11), (B) TRAIL-mediated tumor cell lysis, and (C) antigen-specific CD8 T-cell-mediated lysis of tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of M7824 on both tumor cell phenotype and immune-mediated lysis. Compared to anti-PD-L1 or M7824mut, M7824 induces immunogenic modulation of urothelial carcinoma cell lines, rendering them more susceptible to immune-mediated recognition and lysis. These findings show the relevance of the dual blockade of PD-L1 and TGF\u03b2 in urothelial carcinoma cell lines and thus support the rationale for future clinical studies of M7824 in patients with urothelial cancer.",

Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) remains an aggressive disease associated with limited treatment options and a reduced survival. In spite of this, the first-line treatment based on platinum-based combinations has remained virtually unchanged for the last 20-30\u00a0years. Similarly, before the advent of the immune checkpoint inhibitors, there were no FDA-approved drugs for second-line therapy. In the last few years, impressive signs of anti-tumor activity have been reported with several immunotherapy agents targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway. Avelumab, a PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitor, is currently being investigated for the treatment of UC. Areas covered: This article will review the pharmacological characteristics of avelumab, the efficacy studies which led to its approval, its safety profile, as well as its place within the management of urothelial carcinoma with immunotherapy. For that matter, we undertook a literature review of all the studies assessing the pharmacology of avelumab and its efficacy within clinical trials. Expert commentary: Avelumab has shown promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with UC. Its dual mechanism of action, blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 and promoting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity could potentially be of great interest since it could produce synergistic clinical efficacy.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC) has long been treated preferably with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, but many patients are cisplatin-ineligible whereas for those who progress on a platinum-based regimen treatment options are limited. We review key recent data regarding immune checkpoint inhibitors that are changing this treatment landscape. RECENT FINDINGS: Since May 2016, five different agents targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, avelumab, durvalumab) have received FDA approval for the treatment of aUC in the platinum-refractory setting, while pembrolizumab and atezolizumab are FDA-approved for cisplatin-ineligible patients in the first-line setting. Clinical outcomes and safety profiles of these agents appear relatively comparable across separate trials; however, only pembrolizumab is supported by level I evidence from a large randomized phase III trial showing overall survival benefit over conventional cytotoxic salvage chemotherapy in the platinum-refractory setting. Pembrolizumab has the highest level of evidence in platinum-refractory aUC, whereas pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have comparable level of evidence in the frontline setting in cisplatin-ineligible patients. Ongoing research is evaluating novel agents, various rational combinations, and sequences, as well as predictive and prognostic biomarkers.",

Until recently, there were no true innovations in the management of locally advanced (aUC) and metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) in the last three decades. Vinflunine has been approved by the EMA (European Medicines Agency) with only limited improvement compared to best supportive care in second line treatment. In addition, gemcitabine/cisplatin has been established as an alternative to methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC). The advent of checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) revolutionized the care of these patients, transforming a unanimously deadly disease into one with hope through sustained disease control. Five immune CPI have recently been approved for aUC/mUC by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) including atezolizumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab. All five CPI are FDA-approved as second-line therapy with atezolizumab and pembrolizumab also being approved for first-line therapy in cisplatin-ineligible patients. The rapid acceptance in the treatment algorithm of UC is based on the impressive clinical efficacy of these agents in some patients, combined with their excellent safety profile. These new agents are indeed the most important advancement in UC care. However, the challenge in the age of precision medicine is to identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from CPIs, as the majority of patients do not respond to CPI. Toward this goal, validation of clinical, molecular and imaging biomarkers that serve for prediction and monitoring of treatment response are of central necessity.",
