Submicroscopic deletions of chromosome 22q11 have been reported in a multiple anomaly syndrome variously labelled as velocardiofacial syndrome, conotruncal anomaly face syndrome, and Di George syndrome. Most 22q11 microdeletions occur sporadically, although in some cases the deletion may be transmitted. We describe two affected sibs with confirmed 22q11 deletions from unaffected parents who are not deleted. Haplotype analysis demonstrates that the deletion in the affected sibs has occurred on the same maternal chromosome 22. Furthermore, an unaffected sib was found to have inherited the same maternal haplotype at 22q11 in an undeleted form. This is the first molecular demonstration of germ line mosaicism for a microdeletion at chromosome 22q11 and highlights the need for caution in estimation of recurrence risks, even when constitutional deletions have been excluded on parental analysis.",

Non-allelic homologous recombination between chromosome-specific LCRs is the most common mechanism leading to recurrent microdeletions and duplications. To look for locus-specific differences, we have used microsatellites to determine the parental and chromosomal origins of a large series of patients with de novo deletions of chromosome 7q11.23 (Williams syndrome), 15q11-q13 (Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome) and 22q11 (Di George syndrome) and duplications of 15q11-q13. Overall the majority of rearrangements were interchromosomal, so arising from unequal meiotic exchange, and there were approximately equal numbers of maternal and paternal deletions. Duplications and deletions of 15q11-q13 appear to be reciprocal products that arise by the same mechanisms. The proportion arising from interchromosomal exchanges varied among deletions with 22q11 the highest and 15q11-q13 the lowest. However, parental and chromosomal origins were not always independent. For 15q11-q13, maternal deletions tended to be interchromosomal while paternal deletions tended to be intrachromosomal; for 22q11 there was a possible excess of maternal cases among intrachromosomal deletions. Several factors are likely to be involved in the formation of recurrent rearrangements and the relative importance of these appear to be locus-specific.",

The phenotypic variability was noted in the \"CATCH 22\" acronym. This acronym doesn't recapitulate the full spectrum of the symptoms. The diagnosis of this syndrome can be done with the prenatal diagnosis, with fetal pathology or with a child alive. METHODS: Review of 52 cases with the microdeletion 22q11. Six cases were diagnosed during the prenatal period, 12 cases at fetal pathology examination, and 34 cases during infancy. RESULTS: Cardiac malformations were the major indications (75%) to search for the microdeletion. The facial dysmorphy was difficult to diagnose during the antenatal period or in dead foetus, thereby it was not often recognized. The renal anomalies usually present in 35% of cases, were diagnosed in only 6 to 16% of the cases in our study. CONCLUSION: Phenotypic diversity of the DiGeorge syndrome is important.

METHOD: A literature search was performed and reviewed using the narrative approach. RESULTS: As a class I SLRP member, asporin, is distinct from other SLRPs. Accumulating evidence demonstrates the involvement of asporin in OA pathogenesis. Many human studies have been conducted to explore the association between the D-repeat polymorphisms and OA susceptibility, but these yield inconsistent results. Possible mechanisms for the involvement of asporin in OA pathology include its influence on TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2) signaling pathways and collagen mineralization. To date, no studies were found to use an asporin-deficient animal model that would help to understand disease mechanisms. Many issues must be addressed to clarify the link between asporin and OA to provide a novel therapeutic strategy for OA, perhaps through controlling and modifying the TGF-\u03b2-ECM system. CONCLUSIONS: Studies examined demonstrate the involvement of asporin in OA pathogenesis, and possible mechanisms by which asporin may be involved in this process have been proposed. However, large-scale interracial studies should be conducted to investigate the association between asporin and OA, and further investigations are needed to obtain a better understanding of the disease mechanism, develop novel therapeutic strategies, and explore new approaches for diagnosis of OA.",

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer shows considerable heterogeneity in disease progression and we propose that markers expressed in tumour stroma may be reliable predictors of aggressive tumour subtypes. METHODS: We have used Kaplan-Meier, univariate and multivariate analysis to correlate the expression of Asporin (ASPN) mRNA and protein with prostate cancer progression in independent cohorts. We used immunohistochemistry and H scoring to document stromal localisation of ASPN in a tissue microarray and mouse prostate cancer model, and correlated expression with reactive stroma, defined using Masson Trichrome staining. We used cell cultures of primary prostate cancer fibroblasts treated with serum-free conditioned media from prostate cancer cell lines to examine regulation of ASPN mRNA in tumour stromal cells. RESULTS: We observed increased expression of ASPN mRNA in a data set derived from benign vs tumour microdissected tissue, and a correlation with biochemical recurrence using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analysis. ASPN protein localised to tumour stroma and elevated expression of ASPN was correlated with decreased time to biochemical recurrence, in a cohort of 326 patients with a median follow up of 9.6 years. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that ASPN was correlated with progression, as were Gleason score, and clinical stage. Additionally, ASPN expression correlated with the presence of reactive stroma, suggesting that it may be a stromal marker expressed in response to the presence of tumour cells and particularly with aggressive tumour subtypes. We observed expression of ASPN in the stroma of tumours induced by p53 inhibition in a mouse model of prostate cancer, and correlation with neuroendocrine marker expression. Finally, we demonstrated that ASPN transcript expression in normal and cancer fibroblasts was regulated by conditioned media derived from the PC3, but not LNCaP, prostate cancer cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ASPN is a stromally expressed biomarker that correlates with disease progression, and is observed in reactive stroma. ASPN expression in stroma may be part of a stromal response to aggressive tumour subtypes.",

Asporin has been implicated as an oncogene in various types of human cancers; however, the roles of asporin in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) have not yet been determined. With clinical samples, we found that asporin was highly expressed in CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and the asporin expression levels were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis status and TNM stage of the patients. Through knockdown of asporin in CRC cell lines RKO and SW620 or overexpression of asporin in cell lines HT-29 and LoVo, we found that asporin could enhance wound healing, migration and invasion abilities of the CRC cells. Further more, with the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) tube formation assays and the xenograft model, we found that asporin promoted the tumor growth through stimulating the VEGF signaling pathway. The portal vein injection models suggested that asporin overexpression stimulated the liver metastasis of HT29 cell line, while asporin knockdown inhibited the liver metastasis of RKO cell line. In addition, asporin was found to augment the phosphorylation of EGFR/src/cortactin signaling pathway, which might be contributed to the biological functions of asporin in CRC metastasis. These results suggested that asporin promoted the tumor growth and metastasis of CRC, and it could be a potential therapeutic target for CRC patients in future.",

Asporin has been reported as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, while asporin-activated invasion has been described in gastric cancer. According to our in silico search, high asporin expresion associates with significantly better relapse free survival (RFS) in patients with low-grade tumors but RFS is significantly worse in patients with grade 3 tumors. In line with other studies, we have confirmed asporin expression by RNA scope in situ hybridization in cancer associated fibroblasts. We have also found asporin expression in the Hs578T breast cancer cell line which we confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. From multiple testing, we found that asporin can be downregulated by bone morphogenetic protein 4 while upregulation may be facilited by serum-free cultivation or by three dimensional growth in stiff Alvetex scaffold. Downregulation by shRNA inhibited invasion of Hs578T as well as of CAFs and T47D cells. Invasion of asporin-negative MDA-MB-231 and BT549 breast cancer cells through collagen type I was enhanced by recombinant asporin.

Chromatin in the interphase nucleus is organised as a hierarchical series of structural domains, including self-interacting domains called topologically associating domains (TADs). This arrangement is thought to bring enhancers into closer physical proximity with their target genes, which often are located hundreds of kilobases away in linear genomic distance. TADs are demarcated by boundary regions bound by architectural proteins, such as CTCF and cohesin, although much remains to be discovered about the structure and function of these domains. Recent studies of TAD boundaries disrupted in engineered mouse models show that boundary mutations can recapitulate human developmental disorders as a result of aberrant promoter-enhancer interactions in the affected TADs. Similar boundary disruptions in certain cancers can result in oncogene overexpression, and CTCF binding sites at boundaries appear to be hyper-mutated across cancers. Further insights into chromatin organisation, in parallel with accumulating whole genome sequence data for disease cohorts, are likely to yield additional valuable insights into the roles of noncoding sequence variation in human disease.",

Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy that is unresponsive to conventional radiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, development of novel immune therapeutic strategies is urgently needed. L-4F, an Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) mimetic peptide, is engineered to mimic the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative functionalities of ApoA-I. In this work, H7 cells were orthotopically implanted in C57BL/6 mice and treated with L-4F. Then, pancreatic cancer progression and the inflammatory microenvironment were investigated in vivo. The cytotoxicity of L-4F toward H7 cells was assessed in vitro. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of L-4F on macrophage polarization by analyzing the polarization and genes of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro. The results show that L-4F substantially reduced the tumorigenicity of H7 cells. L-4F inhibited inflammation by reducing the accumulation of inflammatory cells, such as IL-17A-, IL-4-, GM-CSF-, IL-1\u03b2-, and IL-6-producing cells and Th1 and Th17. Notably, L-4F also decreased the percentage of macrophages in tumor tissues, especially M2 macrophages (CD11bF4/80CD206), which was also confirmed in vitro. Additionally, the expression of the M2 marker genes Arg1, MRC1, and CCL22 and the inflammatory genes IL-6, iNOS, and IL-12 was decreased by L-4F, indicating that L-4F prevents M2 type macrophage polarization. However, L-4F could not directly attenuate H7 cell invasion or proliferation and did not induce apoptosis. In addition, L-4F potently down-regulated STAT3, JNK and ERK signaling pathways but not affects the phosphorylation of p38 in RAW 264.7 cells. These results suggest that L-4F exhibits an effective therapeutic effect on pancreatic cancer progression by inhibiting tumor-associated macrophages and inflammation.",

BACKGROUND: Many data highlight the benefits of the Mediterranean diet and its main lipid component, extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO). EVOO contains many phenolic compounds that have been found effective against several aging- and lifestyle-related diseases, including neurodegeneration. Oleuropein, a phenolic secoiroid glycoside, is the main polyphenol in the olive oil. It has been reported that the aglycone form of Oleuropein (OleA) interferes in vitro and in vivo with amyloid aggregation of a number of proteins/peptides involved in amyloid, particularly neurodegenerative, diseases avoiding the growth of toxic oligomers and displaying protection against cognitive deterioration. METHODS: In this study, we carried out a cellular and biophysical study on the relationships between the effects of OleA on the aggregation and cell interactions of the D76N \u03b22-microglobulin (D76N b2m) variant associated with a familial form of systemic amyloidosis with progressive bowel dysfunction and extensive visceral amyloid deposits. RESULTS: Our results indicate that OleA protection against D76N b2m cytotoxicity results from i) a modification of the conformational and biophysical properties of its amyloid fibrils; ii) a modification of the cell bilayer surface properties of exposed cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that OleA remodels not only D76N b2m aggregates but also the cell membrane interfering with the misfolded proteins-cell membrane association, in most cases an early event triggering amyloid-mediated cytotoxicity.

Adipose tissue is an enormously active endocrine organ, secreting various hormones, such as adiponectin, leptin, resistin and visfatin, together with classical cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). All these adipocytokines play significant roles in the regulation of energy metabolism, glucose and lipid metabolism, reproduction, cardiovascular function and immunity. Adipocytokines are significantly regulated by nutritional status and can directly influence other organ systems, including brain, liver and skeletal muscle. Adiponectin plays a key role as an anti-inflammatory hormone. Upregulated expression of resistin, vaspin, apelin and TNF-\u03b1 plays a significant role in induction of insulin resistance linked with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Ghrelin, the circulating peptide, has been found to stimulate appetite and regulate energy balance. Thus, it can be considered 1 of the candidate genes for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Omentin is a novel adipokine produced by visceral adipose tissue. Circulating levels of omentin are decreased in insulin-resistant states, for example, in obesity and diabetes. IL-6 plays a vital role in regulating the accumulation of lipids intramyocardially. Based on the biologic relevance of these adipocytokines, they can no longer be considered as energy storage sites alone but must also be considered in metabolic control. Hence, the present review summarizes the regulatory roles of adipocytokines in diabetes linked with obesity.",

OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence has suggested that microRNAs play critical roles in the development and progression of human glioma. The role of miR-122 in glioma tumorigenesis has been poorly defined. The current study is designed to investigate whether and how miR-122 affects proliferation and apoptosis of human glioma cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 8 normal brain tissues and 19 glioma tissues (7 for low grade and 12 for high grade) were collected. The expressions of miR-122 and runt-related transcription factors (RUNX2) in normal brain/glioma tissues and normal astrocytes (NHA)/multiple glioma cell lines (U87, U251, and U118) were analyzed by Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Western blot and luciferase activity assays were performed to validate the predicted relationship between miR-122 and RUNX2. The effects of miR-122 on cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony forming, and Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis assays using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. RESULTS: MiR-122 expression is downregulated in glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues, and is negatively correlated with the WHO grade. In contrast, the RUNX2 expression is upregulated in glioma tissues, and is positively correlated with the WHO grade. In glioma cell lines, the miR-122 expression is also constantly downregulated. MiR-122 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis, which is achieved by directly targeting RUNX2. Overexpression of RUNX2 can partially abrogate the effect of miR-122 on glioma cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a crucial role of miR-122 in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Identifying the miR-122/RUNX2 signaling provides novel insights into the development of therapeutic targets for glioma.",

BACKGROUND: Exosomes, via heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expressed in their membrane, are able to interact with the toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs), thereby activating them. METHODS: We analyzed exosomes from mouse (C57Bl/6) and breast, lung, and ovarian cancer patient samples and cultured cancer cells with different approaches, including nanoparticle tracking analysis, biolayer interferometry, FACS, and electron microscopy. Data were analyzed with the Student's t and Mann-Whitney tests. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We showed that the A8 peptide aptamer binds to the extracellular domain of membrane HSP70 and used the aptamer to capture HSP70 exosomes from cancer patient samples. The number of HSP70 exosomes was higher in cancer patients than in healthy donors (mean, ng/mL \u00b1 SD = 3.5 \u00b1 1.7 vs 0.17 \u00b1 0.11, respectively, P = .004). Accordingly, all cancer cell lines examined abundantly released HSP70 exosomes, whereas \"normal\" cells did not. HSP70 had higher affinity for A8 than for TLR2; thus, A8 blocked HSP70/TLR2 association and the ability of tumor-derived exosomes to activate MDSCs. Treatment of tumor-bearing C57Bl/6 mice with A8 induced a decrease in the number of MDSCs in the spleen and inhibited tumor progression (n = 6 mice per group). Chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin or 5FU increase the amount of HSP70 exosomes, favoring the activation of MDSCs and hampering the development of an antitumor immune response. In contrast, this MDSC activation was not observed if cisplatin or 5FU was combined with A8. As a result, the antitumor effect of the drugs was strongly potentiated. CONCLUSIONS: A8 might be useful for quantifying tumor-derived exosomes and for cancer therapy through MDSC inhibition.",

Plasma-derived vesicles hold a promising potential for use in biomedical applications. Two major challenges, however, hinder their implementation into translational tools: (a) the incomplete characterization of the protein composition of plasma-derived vesicles, in the size range of exosomes, as mass spectrometric analysis of plasma sub-components is recognizably troublesome and (b) the limited reach of vesicle-based studies in settings where the infrastructural demand of ultracentrifugation, the most widely used isolation/purification methodology, is not available. In this study, we have addressed both challenges by carrying-out mass spectrometry (MS) analyses of plasma-derived vesicles, in the size range of exosomes, from healthy donors obtained by 2 alternative methodologies: size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on sepharose columns and Exo-Spin\u2122. No exosome markers, as opposed to the most abundant plasma proteins, were detected by Exo-Spin\u2122. In contrast, exosomal markers were present in the early fractions of SEC where the most abundant plasma proteins have been largely excluded. Noticeably, after a cross-comparative analysis of all published studies using MS to characterize plasma-derived exosomes from healthy individuals, we also observed a paucity of \"classical exosome markers.\" Independent of the isolation method, however, we consistently identified 2 proteins, CD5 antigen-like (CD5L) and galectin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP), whose presence was validated by a bead-exosome FACS assay. Altogether, our results support the use of SEC as a stand-alone methodology to obtain preparations of extracellular vesicles, in the size range of exosomes, from plasma and suggest the use of CD5L and LGALS3BP as more suitable markers of plasma-derived vesicles in MS.",

The first evidence for long-term transmission of CT's toxic effect via extracellular vesicles was obtained in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To follow the CT intracellular route towards exosome secretion, we used a novel strategy for generating metabolically-labeled fluorescent exosomes that can be counted by flow cytometry assay (FACS) and characterized. Our results clearly show the association of CT with exosomes, together with the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) molecules, proteins required for translocation of CTA across the ER membrane into the cytoplasm. Confocal microscopy showed direct internalization of CT containing fluorescent exo into CHO cells coupled with morphological changes in the recipient cells that are characteristic of CT action. Moreover, Me665 cells treated with CT-containing exosomes showed an increase in Adenosine 3',5'-Cyclic Monophosphate (cAMP) level, reaching levels comparable to those seen in cells exposed directly to CT. Our results prompt the idea that CT can exploit an exosome-mediated cell communication pathway to extend its pathophysiological action beyond an initial host cell, into a multitude of cells.

BACKGROUND: Microenvironment cues involved in melanoma progression are largely unknown. Melanoma is highly influenced in its aggressive phenotype by the changes it determinates in its microenvironment, such as pH decrease, in turn influencing cancer cell invasiveness, progression and tissue remodelling through an abundant secretion of exosomes, dictating cancer strategy to the whole host. A role of exosomes in driving melanoma progression under microenvironmental acidity was never described. METHODS: We studied four differently staged human melanoma lines, reflecting melanoma progression, under microenvironmental acidic pHs pressure ranging between pH\u00a06.0-6.7. To estimate exosome secretion as a function of tumor stage and environmental pH, we applied a technique to generate native fluorescent exosomes characterized by vesicles integrity, size, density, markers expression, and quantifiable by direct FACS analysis. Functional roles of exosomes were tested in migration and invasion tests. Then we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of acid versus control exosomes to elucidate a specific signature involved in melanoma progression. RESULTS: We found that metastatic melanoma secretes a higher exosome amount than primary melanoma, and that acidic pH increases exosome secretion when melanoma is in an intermediate stage, i.e. metastatic non-invasive. We were thus able to show that acidic pH influences the intercellular cross-talk mediated by exosomes. In fact when exposed to exosomes produced in an acidic medium, pH na\u00efve melanoma cells acquire migratory and invasive capacities likely due to transfer of metastatic exosomal proteins, favoring cell motility and angiogenesis. A Prognoscan-based meta-analysis study of proteins enriched in acidic exosomes, identified 11 genes (HRAS, GANAB, CFL2, HSP90B1, HSP90AB1, GSN, HSPA1L, NRAS, HSPA5, TIMP3,\u00a0HYOU1), significantly correlating with poor prognosis, whose high expression was in part confirmed in bioptic samples of lymph node metastases. CONCLUSIONS: A crucial step of melanoma progression does occur at melanoma intermediate -stage, when extracellular acidic pH induces an abundant release and intra-tumoral uptake of exosomes. Such exosomes are endowed with pro-invasive molecules of clinical relevance, which may provide a signature of melanoma advancement.",

BACKGROUND: Despite the high cure rate of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), drug resistance to chemotherapy remains a significant clinical problem. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) protect leukemic cells from chemotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to uncover the mechanism of MSC-induced chemoresistance in T-ALL cells, thus providing a promising clinical therapy target. METHODS: Cell viability was determined using the viability assay kit CCK-8. The mitochondrial ROS levels were detected using the fluorescent probe MitoSOX\u2122 Red, and fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry. In vitro, MSCs and Jurkat cells were cocultured. MSCs were labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and Jurkat cells were labeled with the mitochondria-specific dye MitoTracker Red. Bidirectional mitochondrial transfer was detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The mechanism of mitochondria transfer was analyzed by inhibitor assays. Transcripts related to Jurkat cell/MSC adhesion in the coculture system were assessed by qRT-PCR. After treatment with a neutralizing antibody against a key adhesion molecule, mitochondria transfer from Jurkat cells to MSCs was again detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Finally, we verified our findings using human primary T-ALL cells cocultured with MSCs. RESULTS: Chemotherapeutic drugs caused intracellular oxidative stress in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells transfer mitochondria to MSCs but receive few mitochondria from MSCs, resulting in chemoresistance. This process of mitochondria transfer is mediated by tunneling nanotubes, which are protrusions that extend from the cell membrane . Moreover, we found that most Jurkat cells adhered to MSCs in the coculture system, which was mediated by the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. Treatment with a neutralizing antibody against ICAM-1 led to a decreased number of adhering Jurkat cells, decreased mitochondria transfer, and increased chemotherapy-induced cell death. CONCLUSIONS: We show evidence that mitochondria transfer from Jurkat cells to MSCs, which is mediated by cell adhesion, may be a potential therapeutic target for T-ALL treatment.",

BACKGROUND: Several biologic therapies are approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). NICE does not specifically recommend switching from one biologic to another, and only ustekinumab (UST; STELARA, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Horsham, PA, USA) is recommended after anti-tumour necrosis factor failure. Secukinumab (SEC; COSENTYX, Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) and certolizumab pegol (CZP; CIMZIA, UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium) have not previously been appraised by NICE. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CZP and SEC for treating active PsA in adults in whom DMARDs have been inadequately effective. DESIGN: Systematic review and economic model. DATA SOURCES: Fourteen databases (including MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched for relevant studies from inception to April 2016 for CZP and SEC studies; update searches were run to identify new comparator studies. REVIEW METHODS: Clinical effectiveness data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were synthesised using Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) methods to investigate the relative efficacy of SEC and CZP compared with comparator therapies. A de novo model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SEC and CZP compared with the other relevant comparators. The model was specified for three subpopulations, in accordance with the NICE scope (patients who have taken one prior DMARD, patients who have taken two or more prior DMARDs and biologic-experienced patients). The models were further classified according to the level of concomitant psoriasis. RESULTS: Nineteen eligible RCTs were included in the systematic review of short-term efficacy. Most studies were well conducted and were rated as being at low risk of bias. Trials of SEC and CZP demonstrated clinically important efficacy in all key clinical outcomes. At 3 months, patients taking 150 mg of SEC [relative risk (RR) 6.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.55 to 15.43] or CZP (RR 3.29, 95% CI 1.94 to 5.56) were more likely to be responders than patients taking placebo. The NMA results for the biologic-naive subpopulations indicated that the effectiveness of SEC and CZP relative to other biologics and each other was uncertain. Limited data were available for the biologic-experienced subpopulation. Longer-term evidence suggested that these newer biologics reduced disease progression, with the benefits being similar to those seen for older biologics. The de novo model generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for three subpopulations and three psoriasis subgroups. In subpopulation 1 (biologic-naive patients who had taken one prior DMARD), CZP was the optimal treatment in the moderate-severe psoriasis subgroup and 150 mg of SEC was optimal in the subgroups of patients with mild-moderate psoriasis or no concomitant psoriasis. In subpopulation 2 (biologic-naive patients who had taken two or more prior DMARDs), etanercept (ETN; ENBREL, Pfizer Inc., New York City, NY, USA) is likely to be the optimal treatment in all subgroups. The ICERs for SEC and CZP versus best supportive care are in the region of \u00a320,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In subpopulation 3 (biologic-experienced patients or patients in whom biologics are contraindicated), UST is likely to be the optimal treatment (ICERs are in the region of \u00a321,000-27,000 per QALY). The optimal treatment in subpopulation 2 was sensitive to the choice of evidence synthesis model. In subpopulations 2 and 3, results were sensitive to the algorithm for Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index costs. The optimal treatment is not sensitive to the use of biosimilar prices for ETN and infliximab (REMICADE, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Kenilworth, NJ, USA). CONCLUSIONS: SEC and CZP may be an effective use of NHS resources, depending on the subpopulation and subgroup of psoriasis severity. There are a number of limitations to this assessment, driven mainly by data availability. FUTURE WORK: Trials are needed to inform effectiveness of biologics in biologic-experienced populations.

Our previous work reported on the transfer of mitochondria via MNTs between cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiac myofibroblasts (MFs); however, the elucidation of the underlying mechanism and pathophysiological significance of this transfer requires additional study. In this study, we determined that the mean movement velocity of mitochondria in MNTs between CMs and MFs was approximately 17.5 \u00b1 2.1 nm/s. Meanwhile, treatment with microtubule polymerisation inhibitors nocodazole or colcemid in cell culture decreased mitochondrial velocity, and knockdown of the microtubule motor protein kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) led to a similar effect, indicating that mitochondrial movement was dependent on microtubules and the motor protein KIF5B. Furthermore, we showed that hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced CM apoptosis was attenuated by coculture with intact or hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated MFs, which transferred mitochondria to CMs. This rescue was prevented either by separating the cells using Transwell culture or by impairing mitochondrial transfer with nocodazole or colcemid treatment.

AIMS: Glioblastomas are highly aggressive and treatment resistant. Increasing evidence suggests that tumour-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs) facilitate tumour progression by acquiring a M2-like phenotype. Our objective was to investigate the prognostic value of TAMs in gliomas using automated quantitative double immunofluorescence. METHODS: Samples from 240 patients with primary glioma were stained with antibodies against ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA-1) and cluster of differentiation 204 (CD204) to detect TAMs and M2-like TAMs. The expression levels were quantified by software-based classifiers. The associations between TAMs, gemistocytic cells and glioblastoma subtype were examined with immuno- and haematoxylin-eosin stainings. Three tissue arrays containing glioblastoma specimens were included to study IBA-1/CD204 levels in central tumour and tumour periphery and to characterize CD204 cells. RESULTS: Our data revealed that the amount of especially CD204 TAMs increases with malignancy grade. In grade III-IV, high CD204 expression was associated with shorter survival, while high IBA-1 intensity correlated with a longer survival. In grade IV, CD204 showed independent prognostic value when adjusting for clinical data and the methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. Our findings were confirmed in two bioinformatics databases. TAMs were more abundant in central tumour tissue, mesenchymal glioblastomas and gliomas with many gemistocytic cells. CD204 TAMs co-expressed proteins related to tumour aggressiveness including matrix metallopeptidase-14 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to use automated quantitative immunofluorescence to determine the prognostic impact of TAMs. Our results suggest that M2-like TAMs hold an unfavourable prognostic value in high-grade gliomas and may contribute to a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment.",

Activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a pivotal role in pancreatic fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Recent studies have suggested a role of IL-33, a newly identified IL-1 family member, in fibrosis. We here examined the expression of IL-33 and the IL-33-mediated regulation of cell functions in PSCs. PSCs were isolated from human and rat pancreas tissues. The expression of IL-33 was examined by Western blotting, PCR, ELISA, and immunostaining. The roles of IL-33 in the regulation of PSC functions were examined by using recombinant IL-33 and small interfering RNA. Activated PSCs expressed IL-33 in the nucleus, and the expression was increased by IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, PDGF-BB, and IFN-\u03b3, but not TGF-\u03b21. Nuclear IL-33 expression was also observed in the pancreatic acinar and ductal cells. IL-1\u03b2 induced IL-33 expression mainly through the activation of NF-\u03baB and ERK pathways and partially through that of p38 MAP kinase, whereas PDGF-BB induced IL-33 expression mainly through the activation of ERK pathway. PSCs expressed soluble ST2, ST2L, and IL-1RAcP, but the expression level of ST2L was relatively low. Recombinant IL-33 did not stimulate key cell functions of PSCs. Decreased IL-33 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased proliferation in response to PDGF-BB. In conclusion, activated PSCs expressed IL-33 in the nucleus. IL-33 might regulate the PDGF-induced proliferation in PSCs.",

They were added individually to cells growing in serum-free medium next to controls in medium supplemented with serum, thus containing a mixture of them all, or in serum-free medium alone. Variations were detected by means of a microarray of 810 antibodies targeting relevant proteins. All tested factors triggered increased proliferation and migration. Further analysis showed that TNF-\u03b1 is the prime factor responsible for the activation of pancreatic stellate cells. CCL4 is associated with cellular neovascularization, whereas FGF2 and IL6 induction led to better cellular survival and decreased apoptotic activity of the stellate cells.

As compared with human red blood cells, Hb-Vs have the same absorbance of 595 nm wavelength light and produce the same level of heat following dye laser irradiation. Small sized Hb-Vs (250 nm) distribute in the plasma phase in blood and tend to flow in the marginal zone of microvessels. Intravenous injections of Hb-Vs caused the dilatation of microvessels, and dye laser treatment with Hb-Vs destroyed the vessel wall effectively. Following the intravenous injection of Hb-Vs, the microvessels contained more Hb that absorbed laser photons and produced heat. This extra Hb tended to flow near the endothelial cells, which were the target of the laser treatment. These attributes of Hb-Vs will potentially contribute to enhancing the efficacy of dye laser treatment for port-wine stains. Hemoglobin is a type of porphyrin.

The discovery of the existence of a prokaryotic cytoskeleton has changed this picture significantly. As a result, the idea has taken shape that the appearance of actin occurred in the very first cell; therefore, the emergence of microfilaments precedes that of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. The discovery of nuclear actin opened new perspective on the field, suggesting that the nuclear activities of actin reflect the functions of primordial actin-like proteins. In this paper, we review the recent literature to explore the evolutionary origin of nuclear actin.

The revitalization of research into nuclear actin occurred after it was found that cellular stresses induce the nuclear localization and alter the structure of actin. These studies provided the first hints that actin has a nuclear function. Subsequently, it was established that the nuclear import and export of actin is highly regulated. While the structures of nuclear actin remain unclear, it can function as monomers, polymers, and even rods. Furthermore, even within a given structure, distinct pools of nuclear actin that can be differentially labeled have been identified. Numerous mechanistic studies have uncovered an array of functions for nuclear actin. It regulates the activity of RNA polymerases, as well as specific transcription factors. Actin also modulates the activity of several chromatin remodeling complexes and histone deacetylases, to ultimately impinge on transcriptional programing and DNA damage repair. Further, nuclear actin mediates chromatin movement and organization. It has roles in meiosis and mitosis, and these functions may be functionally conserved from ancient bacterial actin homologs. The structure and integrity of the nuclear envelope and sub-nuclear compartments are also regulated by nuclear actin. Furthermore, nuclear actin contributes to human diseases like cancer, neurodegeneration, and myopathies.

A novel three-way Philadelphia translocation variant, t(9;22;17)(q34;q11.2;q11.2), was identified in a 54-year old man who presented with leukocytosis, anemia and thrombocytosis that was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic phase. Cytogenetic analysis by G-banding revealed the presence of a three-way translocation involving the long arms of chromosomes 9, 22 and 17. Fluorescence is situ hybridization utilizing a dual-color fusion probe confirmed the presence of the Bcr-Abl fusion gene.",

Chronic myeloid leukemia is a stem cell disease with the presence of Philadelphia chromosome generated through reciprocal translocation of chromosome 9 and 22. The use of first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been successful to an extent. However, resistance against such drugs is an emerging problem. Apart from several drug-resistant mechanisms, drug influx/efflux ratio appears to be one of the key determinants of therapeutic outcomes. In addition, intracellular accumulation of drug critically depends on cell membrane fluidity and lipid raft dynamics. Previously, we reported two novel cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), namely, cationic IR15 and anionic SR11 present in tryptic digest of Abrus agglutinin. Here, the potential of IR15 and SR11 to influence intracellular concentration of imatinib has been evaluated. Fluorescent correlation spectroscopy and lifetime imaging were employed to map membrane fluidity and lipid raft distribution following peptide-drug co-administration. Results show that IR15 and SR11 are the two CPPs which can modulate membrane fluidity and lipid raft distribution in K562 cells.

Methods: This was a prospective observational study of vedolizumab-treated breastfeeding patients with IBD. Serum and breast milk samples were obtained at pre-defined tim -points. The in-house developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] for measuring vedolizumab in blood was adapted and validated for measurement of the drug in breast milk. The level of vedolizumab was also measured in breast milk of a control group of nursing healthy mothers. Results: Vedolizumab was undetectable in breast milk in IBD patients before the first infusion of vedolizumab [n = 3] and in all of the healthy controls [n = 5]. Vedolizumab was measurable in all lactating women who received vedolizumab [n = 5]. However, on serial measurements in breast milk after an infusion, drug levels did not surpass 480 ng/ml, which was roughly 1/100 of the comparable serum levels. Conclusions: Vedolizumab can be detected in the breast milk of nursing mothers.

Here we propose a model of stem cell differentiation in which cell-fate determinants work synergistically to determine different cellular identities, and reside in a class of GRN motifs known as feedback loops. Based on this model, we develop a computational method that can systematically predict cell-fate determinants and their GRN motifs. The method was able to recapitulate experimentally validated cell-fate determinants, and validation of two predicted cell-fate determinants confirmed that overexpression of ESR1 and RUNX2 in mouse neural stem cells induces neuronal and astrocyte differentiation, respectively.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Pachypodium (Apocynaceae) is a genus of iconic stem-succulent and poisonous plants endemic to Madagascar and southern Africa. We tested hypotheses about the mode of action and macroevolution of toxicity in this group. We further hypothesized that while monarch butterflies are highly resistant to cardenolide toxins (a type of cardiac glycoside) from American Asclepias, they may be negatively affected by Pachypodium defenses, which evolved independently. METHODS: We grew 16 of 21 known Pachypodium spp. and quantified putative cardenolides by HPLC and also by inhibition of animal Na /K -ATPase (the physiological target of cardiac glycosides) using an in vitro assay. Pachypodium extracts were tested against monarch caterpillars in a feeding bioassay. We also tested four Asclepias spp. and five Pachypodium spp. extracts, contrasting inhibition of the cardenolide-sensitive porcine Na /K -ATPase to the monarch's resistant form. KEY RESULTS: We found evidence for low cardenolides by HPLC, but substantial toxicity when extracts were assayed on Na /K -ATPases. Toxicity showed phylogenetic signal, and taller species showed greater toxicity (this was marginal after phylogenetic correction). Application\u00a0of Pachypodium extracts to milkweed leaves reduced monarch growth, and this was predicted by inhibition of the sensitive Na /K -ATPase in phylogenetic analyses. Asclepias extracts were 100-fold less potent against the monarch compared to the porcine Na /K -ATPase, but this difference was absent for Pachypodium extracts. CONCLUSIONS: Pachypodium contains potent toxicity capable of inhibiting sensitive and cardenolide-adapted Na /K -ATPases. Given the monarch's sensitivity to Pachypodium, we suggest that these plants contain novel cardiac glycosides or other compounds that facilitate toxicity by binding to Na /K -ATPases.",

Cancer is an important public health problem, being one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Most antineoplastic agents cause severe toxic effects and some types of cancer do not respond or are resistant to the existing pharmacotherapy, necessitating the research and development of new therapeutic strategies. Cardenolides have shown significant antitumor activity due to their ability to inhibit the NaKATPase enzyme, and the expression of this enzyme is increased in tumor cells. Glucoevatromonoside containing peracetylated glucose hydroxyl groups (GEVPG) is a cardenolide derivative that has low solubility in aqueous media, which constitutes a barrier to its potential biological applications. In this context, the use of liposomes represents a promising strategy to deliver GEVPG, thus allowing its intravenous administration. In this study, long-circulating and fusogenic liposomes containing GEVPG (SpHL-GEVPG) were developed, and their chemical and physicochemical properties were evaluated. SpHL-GEVPG presented adequate properties, including a mean diameter of 182.2 \u00b1 2.7 nm, a polydispersity index equal to 0.36 \u00b1 0.03, a zeta potential of -2.37 \u00b1 0.31 mV, and a GEVPG entrapment of 0.38 \u00b1 0.04 mg/mL. Moreover, this formulation showed a good stability after having been stored for 30 days at 4 \u00b0C. The cytotoxic studies against breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and SKBR-3) and lung (A549) cancer cell lines demonstrated that SpHL-GEVPG treatment significantly reduced the cell viability. In addition, the SpHL-GEVPG formulation presented a good selectivity toward these cancer cells. The evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment with SpHL-GEVPG showed a potent anticancer effect in an A549 human lung cancer xenograft model. SpHL-GEVPG administered at doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg (i.v.) induced antitumor effect comparable to paclitaxel given at dose of 10 mg/kg (i.v.) to mice.

Previously, we reported that a variety of cardenolides impart anti-transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) activity in swine testicular (ST) cells, through targeting of the cell membrane sodium/potassium pump, Na/K-ATPase. Herein, we further explore the potential signaling cascades associated with this anti-TGEV activity in ST cells. Ouabain, a representative cardenolide, was found to potently diminish TGEV titers and inhibit the TGEV-induced production of IL-6 in a dose dependent manner, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 37 nM and 23 nM respectively. By pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing, we demonstrated that PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling was induced in TGEV-infected ST cells, and ouabain imparted a degree of anti-TGEV activity via further augmentation of this existing PI3K_PDK1 axis signaling, in a manner dependent upon its association with the Na/K-ATPase. Finally, inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 or PDK1 by BX795 antagonized the anti-viral activity of ouabain and restored the TGEV virus titer and yields. This finding is the first report of a PI3K_PDK1 signaling axis further induced by ouabain and implicated in the suppression of TGEV activity and replication; greatly illuminates the underlying mechanism of cardenolide toxicity; and is expected to result in one or more anti-viral applications for the cardenolides in the future.",

Recent studies have identified a range of interactions between type IX collagen and other cartilage matrix components. To determine the extent to which these interactions are important in maintaining the integrity of ageing articular cartilage, we analyzed an age range of normal healthy articular cartilage samples by Western blotting, immunohistochemical, and PCR analyses. Reduced levels of type IX collagen were detected in post adolescence cartilage. Type IX collagen epitopes were evident throughout the matrix in all cartilage samples up to 19 years of age. Post adolescence, however, the pattern of immunoreactivity revealed territorial staining only. Type IX collagen expression at the transcriptional level is maintained at all ages. Type IX collagen fragments were extracted from young tissue, supporting the hypothesis that young cartilage is continually remodelled, while mature cartilage maintains relatively low levels of collagen turnover. Clearly the age changes we observed may have significant effects on the integrity of the tissue as the chondrocytes in ageing articular cartilage have limited capacity to turnover the interterritorial matrix. However, this study provides evidence that even in old age, the chondrocyte attempts to maintain its pericellular environment and hence its mechanical role. Therefore, the potential of type IX collagen to interact with other matrix components continues to be of importance in the territorial environment, and these interactions may have significant roles in mechanotransduction.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), their inhibitors, and the turnover of matrix molecules in articular cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Synovial fluid samples were collected from the knees of 54 patients with OA. Radiographic evaluations and magnetic resonance imaging were performed on the knees of 34 OA patients to classify the stage of the disease. Biochemical analyses and immunoassays were used to measure the concentrations of MMP-1, MMP-3, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), TIMP-2, the disaccharide of hyaluronic acid, the proteoglycan glycosaminoglycan disaccharides of chondroitin 4-sulfate (delta di-CS4) and chondroitin 6-sulfate (delta di-CS6), the 846 epitope on chondroitin sulfate of cartilage proteoglycan aggrecan (putative biosynthetic marker), the keratan sulfate (KS) epitope of aggrecan (putative degradation marker), and the C-propeptide of cartilage type II procollagen (CPII) (biosynthetic marker). RESULTS: The concentration of TIMP-1 was directly correlated with the levels of MMP-1 and MMP-3 (both were also correlated with each other), confirming earlier results. There was an inverse correlation between the delta di-CS6:delta di-CS4 ratio and the concentration of MMP-3. The level of delta di-CS6 was correlated with that of the KS epitope, and to a lesser degree, with that of the 846 epitope (the latter was also correlated with the level of delta di-CS4). The concentration of TIMP-1 correlated with that of the 846 epitope, whereas TIMP-2 levels correlated with those of CPII. There were significantly lower concentrations of delta di-CS6, delta di-CS4, the 846 epitope, and CPII in synovial fluid from patients with late-stage OA. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest a link between proteolysis and inhibitor concentrations in OA cartilage. Production of TIMPs appears to be individually linked to the synthesis of specific cartilage molecules. The reduction in the amount of cartilage-matrix structural components suggests that there is a measurable loss of cartilage in the late stages of the disease, as suggested previously. The resultant composition of the cartilage suggests that the loss may primarily involve \"resident\" molecules originally present in healthy cartilage.",

We employ ensemble docking simulations to characterize the interactions of two enantiomeric forms of a Ru-complex compound (1-R and 1-S) with three protein kinases, namely PIM1, GSK-3\u03b2, and CDK2/cyclin A. We show that our ensemble docking computational protocol adequately models the structural features of these interactions and discriminates between competing conformational clusters of ligand-bound protein structures. Using the determined X-ray crystal structure of PIM1 complexed to the compound 1-R as a control, we discuss the importance of including the protein flexibility inherent in the ensemble docking protocol, for the accuracy of the structure prediction of the bound state. A comparison of our ensemble docking results suggests that PIM1 and GSK-3\u03b2 bind the two enantiomers in similar fashion, through two primary binding modes: conformation I, which is very similar to the conformation presented in the existing PIM1/compound 1-R crystal structure; conformation II, which represents a 180\u00b0 flip about an axis through the NH group of the pyridocarbazole moiety, relative to conformation I.

The top scoring conformation of the inhibitor bound to CDK2 is not present among the top-scoring conformations of the inhibitor bound to either PIM1 or GSK-3\u03b2 and vice-versa.

We have studied the subtleties of fragment docking and binding using data generated in a Pim-1 kinase inhibitor program. Crystallographic and docking data analyses have been undertaken using inhibitor complexes derived from an in-house surface plasmon resonance (SPR) fragment screen, a virtual needle screen, and a de novo designed fragment inhibitor hybrid. These investigations highlight that fragments that do not fill their binding pocket can exhibit promiscuous hydrophobic interactions due to the lack of steric constraints imposed on them by the boundaries of said pocket. As a result, docking modes that disagree with an observed crystal structure but maintain key crystallographically observed hydrogen bonds still have potential value in ligand design and optimization. This observation runs counter to the lore in fragment-based drug design that all fragment elaboration must be based on the parent crystal structure alone.",

The Pim kinases are a family of three vertebrate protein serine/threonine kinases (Pim-1, -2, and -3) belonging to the CAMK (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-related) group. Pim kinases are emerging as important mediators of cytokine signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells, and they contribute to the progression of certain leukemias and solid tumors. A number of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins are phosphorylated by Pim kinases and may act as their effectors in normal physiology and in disease. Recent crystallographic studies of Pim-1 have identified unique structural features but have not provided insight into how the kinase recognizes its target substrates. Here, we have conducted peptide library screens to exhaustively determine the sequence specificity of active site-mediated phosphorylation by Pim-1 and Pim-3. We have identified the major site of Pim-1 autophosphorylation and find surprisingly that it maps to a novel site that diverges from its consensus phosphorylation motif. We have solved the crystal structure of Pim-1 bound to a high affinity peptide substrate in complexes with either the ATP analog AMP-PNP or the bisindolylmaleimide kinase inhibitor 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)maleimide HCl. These structures reveal an unanticipated mode of recognition for basic residues upstream of the phosphorylation site, distinct from that of other kinases with similar substrate specificity. The structures provide a rationale for the unusually high affinity of Pim kinases for peptide substrates and suggest a general mode for substrate binding to members of the CAMK group.",

Pim1, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in several biological functions including cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. While pim1 has been shown to be involved in several hematopoietic cancers, it was also recently identified as a target of aberrant somatic hypermutation in diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), the most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The crystal structures of Pim1 in apo form and bound with AMPPNP have been solved and several unique features of Pim1 were identified, including the presence of an extra beta-hairpin in the N-terminal lobe and an unusual conformation of the hinge connecting the two lobes of the enzyme. While the apo Pim1 structure is nearly identical with that reported recently, the structure of AMPPNP bound to Pim1 is significantly different. Pim1 is unique among protein kinases due to the presence of a proline residue at position 123 that precludes the formation of the canonical second hydrogen bond between the hinge backbone and the adenine moiety of ATP. One crystal structure reported here shows that changing P123 to methionine, a common residue that offers the backbone hydrogen bond to ATP, does not restore the ATP binding pocket of Pim1 to that of a typical kinase. These unique structural features in Pim1 result in novel binding modes of AMP and a known kinase inhibitor scaffold, as shown by co-crystallography. In addition, the kinase activities of five Pim1 mutants identified in DLCL patients have been determined. In each case, the observed effects on kinase activity are consistent with the predicted consequences of the mutation on the Pim1 structure. Finally, 70 co-crystal structures of low molecular mass, low-affinity compounds with Pim1 have been solved in order to identify novel chemical classes as potential Pim1 inhibitors.

Numerous anti-cancer agents inhibit cell cycle progression via a p53-dependent mechanism; however, other genes such as the proto-oncogene c-Myc are promising targets for anticancer therapy. In the present study, we provide evidence that ascochlorin, an isoprenoid antibiotic, is a non-toxic anti-cancer agent that induces G1 cell cycle arrest and p21 expression by downregulating of c-Myc protein expression. Ascochlorin promoted the G1 arrest, upregulated p53 and p21 , and downregulated c-Myc in HCT116 cells. In p53-deficient cells, ascochlorin enhanced the expression of G1 arrest-related genes except p53. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated c-Myc silencing indicated that the transcriptional repression of c-Myc was related to ascochlorin-mediated modulation of p21 expression. Ascochlorin suppressed the stabilization of the c-Myc protein by inhibiting ERK and P70S6K/4EBP1 phosphorylation, whereas it had no effect on c-Myc degradation mediated by PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2. The ERK inhibitor PD98059 and siRNA-mediated ERK silencing induced G1 arrest and p21 expression by downregulating c-Myc in p53-deficient cells. These results indicated that ascochlorin-induced G1 arrest is associated with the repression of ERK phosphorylation and c-Myc expression.

We previously reported that in Alzheimer's disease patients, a high level of GM-CSF in the brain parenchyma downregulated expression of ZO-1, a blood-brain barrier tight junction protein, and facilitated the infiltration of peripheral monocytes across the blood-brain barrier. However, the molecular mechanism underlying regulation of ZO-1 expression by GM-CSF is unclear. Herein, we found that the erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor ERG cooperated with the proto-oncogene protein c-MYC in regulation of ZO-1 transcription in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). The ERG expression was suppressed by miR-96 which was increased by GM-CSF through the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway.
