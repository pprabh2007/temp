Sandhoff disease (SD) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation of the \u03b2-subunit gene \u03b2-hexosaminidase B (HexB) in humans, which results in the massive accumulation of the ganglioside GM2 and related glycosphingolipids in the nervous system. SD causes progressive neurodegeneration and changes in white matter in human infants. An animal model of SD has been established, Hexb-deficient (Hexb) mice, which shows abnormalities resembling the severe phenotype found in human infants. Previously, we reported that the activation state of microglia caused astrogliosis in the early stage of Hexb mouse development. To study how the symptoms of SD develop, we explored the difference in gene expression between 4-week-old Hexb and Hexb mouse cerebral cortices by microarray analysis. The data indicated not only the upregulation of immune system-related genes but also the downregulation of myelin-related genes in the 4-week-old Hexb mouse cerebral cortices. To test the correlation between inflammation and dysmyelination, we generated double-knockout mice of Hexb and the Fc receptor \u03b3 gene (Fcr\u03b3), which is a regulator of autoimmune responses. Dysmyelination recovered in these double-knockout mice. The number of oligodendrocyte progenitors, which expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1, did not change in the 2-week-old mouse brain. These results indicate that microglial activation plays an important role in the myelination process, without influencing the number of oligodendrocyte progenitors, in the development of Hexb mice.",

Approximately 70 lysosomal storage diseases are currently known, resulting from mutations in genes encoding lysosomal enzymes and membrane proteins. Defects in lysosomal enzymes that hydrolyze sphingolipids have been relatively well studied. Gaucher disease is caused by the loss of activity of glucocerebrosidase, leading to accumulation of glucosylceramide. Gaucher disease exhibits a number of subtypes, with types 2 and 3 showing significant neuropathology. Sandhoff disease results from the defective activity of \u03b2-hexosaminidase, leading to accumulation of ganglioside GM2. Niemann-Pick type C disease is primarily caused by the loss of activity of the lysosomal membrane protein, NPC1, leading to storage of cholesterol and sphingosine. All three disorders display significant neuropathology, accompanied by neuroinflammation. It is commonly assumed that neuroinflammation is the result of infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the brain; for instance, cells resembling lipid-engorged macrophages ('Gaucher cells') have been observed in the brain of Gaucher disease patients. We now review the evidence that inflammatory macrophages are recruited into the brain in these diseases and then go on to provide some experimental data that, at least in the three mouse models tested, monocyte-derived macrophages do not appear to infiltrate the brain. Resident microglia, which are phenotypically distinct from infiltrating macrophages, are the only myeloid population present in significant numbers within the brain parenchyma in these authentic mouse models, even during the late symptomatic stages of disease when there is substantial neuroinflammation.

Sandhoff disease (SD) results from mutations in the HEXB gene, subsequent deficiency of N-acetyl-\u03b2-hexosaminidase (Hex) and accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. SD leads to progressive neurodegeneration and early death. However, there is a lack of established SD biomarkers, while the pathogenesis etiology remains to be elucidated. To identify potential biomarkers and unveil the pathogenic mechanisms, metabolomics analysis with reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) was conducted. A total of 177, 112 and 119 metabolites were found to be significantly dysregulated in mouse liver, mouse brain and human hippocampus samples, respectively (p < .05, ID score > 0.5). Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis of the metabolites showed clear separation of metabolomics profiles between normal and diseased individuals. Among these metabolites, dipeptides, amino acids and derivatives were elevated, indicating a robust protein catabolism. Through pathway enrichment analysis, we also found alterations in metabolites associated with neurotransmission, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulphate, key component of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was significantly elevated, which was also confirmed by biochemical assays. Collectively, these results indicated major shifts of energy utilization and profound metabolic impairments, contributing to the pathogenesis mechanisms of SD. Global metabolomics profiling may provide an innovative tool for better understanding the disease mechanisms, and identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers for SD.",

Sandhoff disease, one of the GM2 gangliosidoses, is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the absence of \u03b2-hexosaminidase A and B activity and the concomitant lysosomal accumulation of its substrate, GM2 ganglioside. It features catastrophic neurodegeneration and death in early childhood. How the lysosomal accumulation of ganglioside might affect the early development of the nervous system is not understood. Recently, cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have illuminated early developmental events altered by disease processes. To develop an early neurodevelopmental model of Sandhoff disease, we first generated iPS cells from the fibroblasts of an infantile Sandhoff disease patient, then corrected one of the mutant HEXB alleles in those iPS cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, thereby creating isogenic controls. Next, we used the parental Sandhoff disease iPS cells and isogenic HEXB-corrected iPS cell clones to generate cerebral organoids that modeled the first trimester of neurodevelopment. The Sandhoff disease organoids, but not the HEXB-corrected organoids, accumulated GM2 ganglioside and exhibited increased size and cellular proliferation compared with the HEXB-corrected organoids. Whole-transcriptome analysis demonstrated that development was impaired in the Sandhoff disease organoids, suggesting that alterations in neuronal differentiation may occur during early development in the GM2 gangliosidoses.",

BACKGROUND: Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes the debilitating neuroinflammatory disease HTLV-1-associated myelopathy-tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM-TSP) as well as adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). In patients with HAM-TSP, HTLV-1 infects mainly CCR4+ T cells and induces functional changes, ultimately causing chronic spinal cord inflammation. We evaluated mogamulizumab, a humanized anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody that targets infected cells, in patients with HAM-TSP. METHODS: In this uncontrolled, phase 1-2a study, we assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of mogamulizumab in patients with glucocorticoid-refractory HAM-TSP. In the phase 1 dose-escalation study, 21 patients received a single infusion of mogamulizumab (at doses of 0.003 mg per kilogram of body weight, 0.01 mg per kilogram, 0.03 mg per kilogram, 0.1 mg per kilogram, or 0.3 mg per kilogram) and were observed for 85 days. Of those patients, 19 continued on to the phase 2a study and received infusions, over a period of 24 weeks, of 0.003 mg per kilogram, 0.01 mg per kilogram, or 0.03 mg per kilogram at 8-week intervals or infusions of 0.1 mg per kilogram or 0.3 mg per kilogram at 12-week intervals. RESULTS: The side effects of mogamulizumab did not limit administration up to the maximum dose (0.3 mg per kilogram). The most frequent side effects were grade 1 or 2 rash (in 48% of the patients) and lymphopenia and leukopenia (each in 33%). The dose-dependent reduction in the proviral load in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (decrease by day 15 of 64.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 51.7 to 78.1) and inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid (decrease by day 29 of 37.3% [95% CI, 24.8 to 49.8] in the CXCL10 level and of 21.0% [95% CI, 10.7 to 31.4] in the neopterin level) was maintained with additional infusions throughout the phase 2a study. A reduction in spasticity was noted in 79% of the patients and a decrease in motor disability in 32%. CONCLUSIONS: Mogamulizumab decreased the number of HTLV-1-infected cells and the levels of inflammatory markers. Rash was the chief side effect. The effect of mogamulizumab on clinical HAM-TSP needs to be clarified in future studies.

Longitudinal monitoring of patients suggests a causal link between chronic periodontitis and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the explanation of how periodontitis can lead to dementia remains unclear. A working hypothesis links extrinsic inflammation as a secondary cause of AD. This hypothesis suggests a compromised oral hygiene leads to a dysbiotic oral microbiome whereby Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone periodontal pathogen, with its companion species, orchestrates immune subversion in the host. Brushing and chewing on teeth supported by already injured soft tissues leads to bacteremias. As a result, a persistent systemic inflammatory response develops to periodontal pathogens. The pathogens, and the host's inflammatory response, subsequently lead to the initiation and progression of multiple metabolic and inflammatory co-morbidities, including AD. Insufficient levels of essential micronutrients can lead to microbial dysbiosis through the growth of periodontal pathogens such as demonstrated for P. gingivalis under low hemin bioavailability. An individual's diet also defines the consortium of microbial communities that take up residency in the oral and gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiomes. Their imbalance can lead to behavioral changes. For example, probiotics enriched in Lactobacillus genus of bacteria, when ingested, exert some anti-inflammatory influence through common host/bacterial neurochemicals, both locally, and through sensory signaling back to the brain. Early life dietary behaviors may cause an imbalance in the host/microbial endocrinology through a dietary intake incompatible with a healthy GI tract microbiome later in life. This imbalance in host/microbial endocrinology may have a lasting impact on mental health. This observation opens up an opportunity to explore the mechanisms, which may underlie the previously detected relationship between diet, oral/GI microbial communities, to anxiety, cognition and sleep patterns. This review suggests healthy diet based interventions that together with improved life style/behavioral changes may reduce and/or delay the incidence of AD.",

BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a part of the first line of defense of the body against invasive pathogens, and plays a crucial role in tissue regeneration and repair. A proper inflammatory response ensures the suitable resolution of inflammation and elimination of harmful stimuli, but when the inflammatory reactions are inappropriate it can lead to damage of the surrounding normal cells. The relationship between infections and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) etiology, especially lateonset AD (LOAD) has been continuously debated over the past three decades. METHODS: This review discusses whether infections could be a causative factor that promotes the progression of AD and summarizes recent investigations associating infectious agents and chronic inflammation with AD. Preventive and therapeutic approaches to AD in the context of an infectious etiology of the disease are also discussed. RESULTS: Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis of the role of neurotropic viruses from the Herpesviridae family, especially Human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Human herpesvirus 2 (HHV-2), in AD neuropathology. Recent investigations also indicate the association between Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and dementia. Among bacteria special attention is focused on spirochetes family and on periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis or Treponema denticola that could cause chronic periodontitis and possibly contribute to the clinical onset of AD. CONCLUSION: Chronic viral, bacterial and fungal infections might be causative factors for the inflammatory pathway in AD.",

Chronic periodontitis may contribute to the risk of onset or progression of neuroinflammatory pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. The main goal of the present study was to investigate if the role of epigenetic modulations is involved in periodontitis using human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) as an in vitro model system. hPDLSCs were treated with lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis and the expression of proteins associated with DNA methylation and histone acetylation, such as DNMT1 and p300, respectively, and inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB, were examined. Immunofluorescence, Western blot and next generation sequencing results demonstrated that P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide significantly reduced DNA methylase DNMT1, while it markedly upregulated the level of histone acetyltransferase p300 and NF-kB in hPDLSCs. Our results showed that P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide markedly regulate the genes involved in epigenetic mechanism, which may result in inflammation induction. We propose that P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-treated hPDLSCs could be a potential in vitro model system to study epigenetics modulations associated with periodontitis, which might be helpful to identify novel biomarkers linked to this oral inflammatory disease.",

Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by infection in the gastrointestinal tract by the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio cholerae, and is a serious public health threat worldwide. There has not been any effective treatment for this infectious disease. Cholera toxin (CT), which is secreted by V. cholerae, can enter host cells by binding to GM1, a monosialoganglioside widely distributed on the plasma membrane surface of various animal epithelial cells. The present study was undertaken to generate peptides that are conformationally similar to the carbohydrate epitope of GM1 for use in the treatment of cholera and related bacterial infection. For this purpose, we used cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit to select CTB-binding peptides that structurally mimic GM1 from a dodecamer phage-display library. Six GM1-replica peptides were selected by biopanning based on CTB recognition. Five of the six peptides showed inhibitory activity for GM1 binding to CTB. To test the potential of employing the peptide mimics for intervening with the bacterial infection, those peptides were examined for their binding capacity, functional inhibitory activity and in vitro effects using a human intestinal epithelial cell line, Caco-2 cells. One of the peptides, P3 (IPQVWRDWFKLP), was most effective in inhibiting cellular uptake of CTB and suppressing CT-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate production in the cells. Our results thus provide convincing evidence that GM1-replica peptides could serve as novel agents to block CTB binding on epithelial cells and prevent the ensuing physiological effects of CT.",

However, the mechanisms governing stabilized raft assembly and function remain unclear. Here, we test the role of glycolipid crosslinking as a raft targeting and ordering mechanism using the well-studied raft marker cholera toxin B pentamer (CTxB) that binds up to five GM1 glycosphingolipids to enter host cells. We show that when applied to cell-derived giant plasma membrane vesicles, a variant of CTxB containing only a single functional GM1 binding site exhibits significantly reduced partitioning to the ordered phase compared to wild-type CTxB with five binding sites. Moreover, monovalent CTxB does not stabilize membrane domains, unlike wild-type CTxB. These results support the long-held hypothesis that CTxB stabilizes raft domains via a lipid crosslinking mechanism and establish a role for crosslinking in the partitioning of CTxB to ordered domains.",

Such simultaneous binding arising from the toxins multivalency is believed to enhance its affinity. Thus, blocking the initial attachment of the toxin to the cell surface using inhibitors with GM1 subunits has the potential to stop the disease. Previously we showed that tetravalent GM1 molecules were sub-nanomolar inhibitors of CTB5. In this study, we synthesized a pentavalent version and compared the binding and potency of penta- and tetravalent cholera toxin inhibitors, based on the same scaffold, for the first time. The pentavalent geometry did not yield major benefits over the tetravalent species, but it was still a strong inhibitor, and no major steric clashes occurred when binding the toxin. Thus, systems which can adopt more geometries, such as those described here, can be equally potent, and this may possibly be due to their ability to form higher-order structures or simply due to more statistical options for binding.",

BACKGROUND: Bathing suit ichthyosis (BSI) is an uncommon phenotype classified as a minor variant of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). OBJECTIVES: We report a case of BSI in a 3-year-old Tunisian girl with a novel mutation of the transglutaminase 1 gene (TGM1). CASE REPORT: This infant had been born with a collodion membrane encasing her entire body. From the age of three months, brownish scaling was noted on the bathing suit area. Histology showed orthohyperkeratosis with acanthosis of the epidermis. The granular layer was normal, and the superficial dermis was mildly inflammatory, confirming a diagnosis of proliferating ichthyosis. Molecular analysis in the patient and her parents revealed the mutation I304F of TGM1. Treatment with emollients and keratolytics partially improved the patient's skin condition. CONCLUSIONS: Bathing suit ichthyosis is an uncommon phenotype unique in its topography, which involves the trunk but spares the face and extremities. Previous studies using molecular analysis have shown that BSI is caused mainly by mutations in TGM1. Twenty missense mutations have been reported in BSI. Of these 20 missense mutations, nine occurred only in patients with the BSI phenotype and 11 were common to BSI and other types of ARCI. Until recently, there has been no genotype-phenotype correlation. Therefore, the same mutation of the transglutaminase 1 could result in either generalized ARCI or BSI. The present case demonstrates this phenotype in a White Tunisian patient with a novel mutation of TGM1 (I304F) not previously reported in BSI.",

RESULTS: Three-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the normalization (n = 70), short (n = 71), and long groups (n = 61) was 41.3%, 46.0%, and 16.8%, respectively (P = 0.002). Five-year overall survival (OS) of normalization, short, and long groups was 72.6, 70.6 and 43.8%, respectively (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that long HL is an independent risk factor for poor RFS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.21, P = 0.0006) and poor OS (HR 2.70, P = 0.004). The extrahepatic recurrence rate was 21.3% (13/61) in the long group, which is higher than in the normalization group (8.6%, 6/70) (P = 0.04) and short group (9.9%, 7/71) (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Post-hepatectomy HLs of AFP and DCP are predictors of long-term outcome in patients with HCC.",

Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has limited treatment options and poor survival, therefore early detection is critical to improving the survival of patients with HCC. Current guidelines for high-risk patients include ultrasound screenings every six months, but ultrasounds are operator dependent and not sensitive for early HCC. Serum \u03b1-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a widely used diagnostic biomarker, but it has limited sensitivity and is not elevated in all HCC cases so, we incorporate a second blood-based biomarker, des'\u03b3 carboxy-prothrombin (DCP), that has shown potential as a screening marker for HCC. The data from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial is a valuable source of data to study biomarker screening for HCC. We assume the trajectories of AFP and DCP follow a joint hierarchical mixture model with random changepoints that allows for distinct changepoint times and subsequent trajectories of each biomarker. The changepoint indicators are jointly modeled with a Markov Random Field distribution to help detect borderline changepoints. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to calculate posterior distributions, which are used in risk calculations among future patients and determine whether a patient has a positive screen. The screening algorithm was compared to alternatives in simulations studies under a range of possible scenarios and in the HALT-C Trial using cross-validation.",

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Extremely poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with progressing disease was denoted by vascular invasion. Cytokeratin 18 (CK18) has been shown to be overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma so it is a valuable tumor marker; however, its role in vascular invasion is still unclear. This study aimed to predict CK18 as a predictive marker for macrovascular malignant invasion. METHODS: The present study was conducted on three groups of patients: group I included 91 HCC patients without macrovascular invasion, group II included 34 HCC patients with radiological evidence of vascular invasion, and group III included 110 control individuals subdivided into IIIA as healthy blood donors and IIIB as post-HCV cirrhotic patients without HCC. RESULTS: ROC curve of M30 fragments of CK18 was constructed for discrimination between HCC with and without macrovascular invasion. Optimum cutoff value was 304.5\u00a0ng/mL (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.997, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98.8%). Regression analysis was conducted for prediction of macrovascular invasion within HCC patients. The following variables: higher levels of AST, M30, bilirubin, and AFP, lower levels of serum albumin, larger tumor size, child B score, and multiple lesions were associated with vascular invasion in univariate analysis. While in multivariate analysis, higher levels of AST and bilirubin and elevated levels of M30 and AFP serum were considered independent predictors for macrovascular invasion in HCC patients. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that increased M30 fragments of CK18 levels may be useful as a possible marker of early tumor invasiveness.",

AIMS: We tested whether transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) signaling plays an important role in hepatic stellate cell differentiation fate and investigated the role of Jagged1/Notch in this process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TGF-\u03b21 was overexpressed and transforming growth factor receptor 1 (TGF-\u03b2-R1) was knocked down by a lentiviral vector in mouse hepatic stellate cells (mHSCs). Transfection efficiency was assessed with immunofluorescence, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. The downstream genes alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), Jagged1 and the differentiation markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin (ALB), cytokeratin19 (CK19), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), and hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) were measured with qRT-PCR and western blotting. KEY FINDINGS: SpHBLV-CMVIE-TGF-\u03b21, pHBLV-CMVIE-GFP, pHBLV-U6-TGF-\u03b2-R1 shRNA, and pHBLV-U6-RFP were successfully transfected. Over-expression of the TGF-\u03b21 gene caused mHSCs to transform into myofibroblasts (MFs) and expression of Jagged1 and cholangiocyte markers (CK19, SOX9, Hes1) were significantly upregulated (P<0.01). Importantly, after blocking TGF-\u03b21 signaling via gene silencing, expression of Jagged1 was much reduced, but the mature hepatocyte marker (ALB) was obviously increased. In addition, AFP, a hepatic stem cell marker, was expressed at the highest level in the control groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings emphasize that the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway regulates expression of Jagged1 in mHSCs which is associated with transformation of mHSCs into MFs, thus demonstrating a novel mechanism via which TGF-\u03b21 signaling controls the differentiation fate of mHSCs through regulation of the Jagged1/Notch pathway.",

The production of cytokines in response to DNA-damage events may be an important host defense response to help prevent the escape of pre-cancerous cells.

STING signaling has been shown to be defective in a variety of cancers, such as colon cancer and melanoma, actions that may enable damaged cells to escape the immunosurveillance system. Here, we report through examination of databases that STING signaling may be commonly suppressed in a greater variety of tumors due to loss-of-function mutation or epigenetic silencing of the STING/cGAS promoter regions. In comparison, RNA activated innate immune pathways controlled by RIG-I/MDA5 were significantly less affected. Examination of reported missense STING variants confirmed that many exhibited a loss-of-function phenotype and could not activate cytokine production following exposure to cytosolic DNA or DNA-damage events.

We describe the development and implementation of a bioinformatics algorithm, copy number variation-random forest (CNV-RF), that incorporates a machine learning component to identify CNVs from targeted NGS data. Using CNV-RF, we identified 12 of 13 deletions in samples with known CNVs, two cases with duplications, and identified novel deletions in 22 additional cases. Furthermore, no CNVs were identified among 60 genes in 14 cases with normal copy number and no CNVs were identified in another 104 patients with clinical suspicion of CNVs. All positive deletions and duplications were confirmed using a quantitative PCR method. CNV-RF also detected heterozygous deletions and duplications with a specificity of 50% across 4813 genes.

BACKGROUND: X-linked hypophosphatemia is characterized by increased secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which leads to hypophosphatemia and consequently rickets, osteomalacia, and skeletal deformities. We investigated burosumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets FGF-23, in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia. METHODS: In an open-label, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 52 children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous burosumab either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks; the dose was adjusted to achieve a serum phosphorus level at the low end of the normal range. The primary end point was the change from baseline to weeks 40 and 64 in the Thacher rickets severity total score (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity). In addition, the Radiographic Global Impression of Change was used to evaluate rachitic changes from baseline to week 40 and to week 64. Additional end points were changes in pharmacodynamic markers, linear growth, physical ability, and patient-reported outcomes and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: The mean Thacher rickets severity total score decreased from 1.9 at baseline to 0.8 at week 40 with every-2-week dosing and from 1.7 at baseline to 1.1 at week 40 with every-4-week dosing (P<0.001 for both comparisons); these improvements persisted at week 64. The mean serum phosphorus level increased after the first dose in both groups, and more than half the patients in both groups had levels within the normal range (3.2 to 6.1 mg per deciliter [1.0 to 2.0 mmol per liter]) by week 6. Stable serum phosphorus levels were maintained through week 64 with every-2-week dosing. Renal tubular phosphate reabsorption increased from baseline in both groups, with an overall mean increase of 0.98 mg per deciliter (0.32 mmol per liter). The mean dose of burosumab at week 40 was 0.98 mg per kilogram of body weight with every-2-week dosing and 1.50 mg per kilogram with every-4-week dosing. Across both groups, the mean serum alkaline phosphatase level decreased from 459 U per liter at baseline to 369 U per liter at week 64. The mean standing-height z score increased in both groups, with greater improvement seen at all time points with every-2-week dosing (an increase from baseline of 0.19 at week 64) than with every-4-week dosing (an increase from baseline of 0.12 at week 64). Physical ability improved and pain decreased. Nearly all the adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: In children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, treatment with burosumab improved renal tubular phosphate reabsorption, serum phosphorus levels, linear growth, and physical function and reduced pain and the severity of rickets.

Phosphate plays essential roles in many biological processes, and the serum phosphate level is tightly controlled. Chronic hypophosphatemia causes impaired mineralization of the bone matrix and results in rickets and osteomalacia. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone that regulates phosphate metabolism. FGF23 excess induces hypophosphatemia via impaired phosphate reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules and decreased phosphate absorption in the intestines. There are several types of genetic and acquired FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. Among these diseases, X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), which is caused by inactivating mutations in the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX) gene, is the most prevalent form of genetic FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets. Another clinically relevant form of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic disease is tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with FGF23-producing tumors. A combination of active vitamin D and phosphate salts is the current medical therapy used to treat patients with XLH and inoperative TIO. However, this therapy has certain efficacy- and safety-associated limitations. Several measures to inhibit FGF23 activity have been considered as possible new treatments for FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. In particular, a humanized monoclonal antibody for FGF23 (burosumab) is a promising treatment in patients with XLH and TIO.

At week 24, 43.1% (burosumab) and 7.7% (placebo) of baseline active fractures were fully healed; the odds of healed fracture in the burosumab group was 16.8-fold greater than that in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption increased significantly from baseline with burosumab treatment compared with placebo. The safety profile of burosumab was similar to placebo. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events or meaningful changes from baseline in serum or urine calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, or nephrocalcinosis. These data support the conclusion that burosumab is a novel therapeutic addressing an important medical need in adults with XLH.\u00a9 2018 The Authors.

The approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and mammalian species, allowing nonhuman sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground-truth data.

BACKGROUND: Recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (cerliponase alfa) is an enzyme-replacement therapy that has been developed to treat neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, a rare lysosomal disorder that causes progressive dementia in children. METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with CLN2 disease who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was initiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received the 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a 2-point decline in the score on the motor and language domains of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale (which ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 representing no function and 3 representing normal function in each of the two domains), which was compared with the time until a 2-point decline in 42 historical controls. We also compared the rate of decline in the motor-language score between the two groups, using data from baseline to the last assessment with a score of more than 0, divided by the length of follow-up (in units of 48 weeks). RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled, 23 of whom constituted the efficacy population. The median time until a 2-point decline in the motor-language score was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls. The mean (\u00b1SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per 48-week period was 0.27\u00b10.35 points in treated patients and 2.12\u00b10.98 points in 42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events included convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure of the intraventricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the intraventricular device that was used to administer the infusion, which required antibiotic treatment and device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 disease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in historical controls. Serious adverse events included failure of the intraventricular device and device-related infections.

Clinical genomic sequencing can identify pathogenic variants unrelated to the initial clinical question, but of medical relevance to the patients and their families. With ongoing discussions on the utility of disclosing or searching for such variants, it is of crucial importance to obtain unbiased insight in the prevalence of these incidental or secondary findings, in order to better weigh potential risks and benefits. Previous studies have reported a broad range of secondary findings ranging from 1 to 9%, merely attributable to differences in study design, cohorts tested, sequence technology used and genes analyzed. Here, we analyzed WES data of 1640 anonymized healthy Dutch individuals to establish the frequency of medically actionable disease alleles in an outbred population of European descent. Our study shows that 1 in 38 healthy individuals (2.7%) has a (likely) pathogenic variant in one of 59 medically actionable dominant disease genes for which the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends disclosure. Additionally, we identified 36 individuals (2.2%) to be a carrier of a recessive pathogenic disease allele. Whereas these frequencies of secondary findings are in line with what has been reported in the East-Asian population, the pathogenic variants are differently distributed across the 59 ACMG genes. Our results contribute to the debate on genetic risk factor screening in healthy individuals and the discussion whether the potential benefits of this knowledge and related preventive options, outweigh the risk of the emotional impact of the test result and possible stigmatization.",

Zoonotic infections are increasingly becoming public health menaces and are usually transmitted to humans due to unsuitable environmental conditions. One of them is hepatic capillariasis, caused by the parasite Capillaria hepatica, primarily a disease of rodents, with hepatic manifestations in humans. Although its prevalence is very low, it can cause significant morbidity and mortality, with cases reported from all over the world. The main infective form for humans is the embryonated egg of the parasite, which hatches in the intestine and ultimately colonize the liver. The larvae mature and reproduce, and eventually form embryonated eggs, which cause chronic focal inflammation and septal hepatic fibrosis. Clinical presentation mainly consists of fever, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and eosinophilia. Spurious infection with unembryonated eggs cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnostic modalities include liver biopsy, ultrasonography, CT scan, immunological tests like ELISA and IIFT. The infection can be treated mainly with a combination of benzimidazoles like thiabendazole, mebendazole and albendazole; with corticosteroids. The study emphasizes the need for hepatic capillariasis to be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of suspected hepatitis, leptospirosis, abdominal lymphadenopathy or other hepatic or parasitic infections prevalent in the region concerned; and meticulously assess the cases to facilitate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, thus reducing the distress faced by patients.",

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving 1649 participants was conducted from January 2013 to July 2016 in Central Java and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Participants received three doses of oral RV3-BB vaccine with the first dose given at 0-5 days after birth (neonatal schedule), or the first dose given at \u223c8 weeks after birth (infant schedule), or placebo (placebo schedule). Stool samples from episodes of gastroenteritis were tested for rotavirus using EIA testing, positive samples were genotyped by RT-PCR. Full genome sequencing was performed on two representative rotavirus strains. RESULTS: There were 1110 episodes of acute gastroenteritis of any severity, 105 episodes were confirmed as rotavirus gastroenteritis by EIA testing. The most common genotype identified was G3P[8] (90/105), the majority (52/56) of severe (Vesikari score > 11) rotavirus gastroenteritis episodes were due to the G3P[8] strain.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of rotavirus specific maternal antibodies on the serum IgA response or stool excretion of vaccine virus after any dose of an oral rotavirus vaccine, RV3-BB, in parallel to a Phase IIa clinical trial conducted at Dunedin Hospital, New Zealand. At the time of the study rotavirus vaccines had not been introduced in New Zealand and the burden of rotavirus disease was evident. METHODS: Rotavirus specific IgG and serum neutralizing antibody (SNA) levels in cord blood and IgA levels in colostrum and breast milk samples collected \u223c4\u00a0weeks, \u223c20\u00a0weeks and \u223c28\u00a0weeks after birth were measured. Infants were randomized to receive the first dose of vaccine at 0-5\u00a0d (neonatal schedule) or 8\u00a0weeks (infant schedule). Breast feeding was with-held for 30\u00a0minutes before and after vaccine administration. The relationship between rotavirus specific IgG and SNA levels in cord blood and IgA in colostrum and breast milk at the time of first active dose of RV3-BB vaccine and level of IgA response and stool excretion after 3 doses of vaccine was assessed using linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: Forty infants received 3 doses of RV3-BB rotavirus vaccine and were included in the analysis of the neonatal and infant groups. Rotavirus specific IgA in colostrum (neonatal schedule group) and breast milk at 4\u00a0weeks (infant schedule group) was identified in 14/21 (67%) and 14/17 (82%) of infants respectively. There was little evidence of an association between IgA in colostrum or breast milk IgA at 4\u00a0weeks, or between cord IgG or SNA level, and IgA response or stool excretion after 3 doses of RV3-BB, or after one dose (neonatal schedule) (all p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The level of IgA in colostrum or breast milk and level of placental IgG and SNA did not impact on the serum IgA response or stool excretion following 3 doses of RV3-BB Rotavirus Vaccine administered using either a neonatal or infant schedule in New Zealand infants.",

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), Merck's anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), received accelerated approval in May 2017 by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as having microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR). Shortly after, nivolumab (Opdivo), Bristol-Myers Squibb's anti-PD-1 mAb, gained an accelerated approval in August 2017 for adult and pediatric patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. These regulatory approvals marked an important milestone that a cancer treatment may be approved based on a common biomarker rather than the anatomic location in the body where the tumor originated, and therefore established a precedent for tumor type-agnostic therapy. In the 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meeting, larotrectinib (LOXO-101), Loxooncology's oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), demonstrated unprecedented efficacy on unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK)-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients. Both the anti-PD-1 mAbs and the TRK-targeting therapies share some basic features: (a) biomarker-based, well-defined rare patient population; (b) exceptionally high clinical efficacy, e.g., near 40% overall response rate (ORR) for pembrolizumab across 15 tumor types with MSI-H/dMMR and 75% ORR for larotrectinib across more than 12 tumor types with NTRK-fusion proteins; (c) durable responses lasting at least 6\u00a0months with complete responses observed; and (d) parallel development in adult and pediatric populations. With increasing accessibility to genetic analysis tools such as next-generation sequencing, tumor type-agnostic therapy has become a reality, both during clinical development and in clinical practice. Adjustments in our approaches to developing new anti-cancer drugs and to adopting these new cancer treatments in clinical practice need to occur in order to prepare ourselves for the new era of precision medicine.",

BACKGROUND: Gene fusions involving NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 (TRK fusions) are found in a broad range of paediatric and adult malignancies. Larotrectinib, a highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of the TRK kinases, had shown activity in preclinical models and in adults with tumours harbouring TRK fusions. This study aimed to assess the safety of larotrectinib in paediatric patients. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study was done at eight sites in the USA and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion status; had a Karnofsky ( > 16 years of age) or Lansky (<16 years of age) performance status score of 50 or more, adequate organ function, and full recovery from the acute toxic effects of all previous anticancer therapy. Following a protocol amendment on Sept 12, 2016, patients with locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma who would require disfiguring surgery to achieve a complete surgical resection were also eligible. Patients were enrolled to three dose cohorts according to a rolling six design. Larotrectinib was administered orally (capsule or liquid formulation), twice daily, on a continuous 28-day schedule, in increasing doses adjusted for age and bodyweight. The primary endpoint of the phase 1 dose escalation component was the safety of larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity. All patients who received at least one dose of larotrectinib were included in the safety analyses. Reported here are results of the phase 1 dose escalation cohort. Phase 1 follow-up and phase 2 are ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02637687. FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2015, and April 13, 2017, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) with a median age of 4\u00b75 years (IQR 1\u00b73-13\u00b73) were enrolled to three dose cohorts: cohorts 1 and 2 were assigned doses on the basis of both age and bodyweight predicted by use of SimCyp modelling to achieve an area under the curve equivalent to the adult doses of 100 mg twice daily (cohort 1) and 150 mg twice daily (cohort 2); and cohort 3 was assigned to receive a dose of 100 mg/m twice daily (maximum 100 mg per dose), regardless of age, equating to a maximum of 173% of the recommended adult phase 2 dose. Among enrolled patients harbouring TRK fusion-positive cancers, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2 (occurring in 21 [88%] of 24 patients); the most common larotrectinib-related adverse events of all grades were increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ten [42%] of 24 each), leucopenia (five [21%] of 24), decreased neutrophil count (five [21%] of 24), and vomiting (five [21%] of 24). Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation was the only dose-limiting toxicity and occurred in one patient without a TRK fusion and with progressive disease. No grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed. Two larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were observed: grade 3 nausea and grade 3 ejection fraction decrease during the 28-day follow-up after discontinuing larotrectinib and while on anthracyclines. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 100 mg/m (maximum of 100 mg per dose) was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response. INTERPRETATION: The TRK inhibitor larotrectinib was well tolerated in paediatric patients and showed encouraging antitumour activity in all patients with TRK fusion-positive tumours. The recommended phase 2 dose was defined as 100mg/m (maximum 100 mg per dose) for infants, children, and adolescents, regardless of age. FUNDING: Loxo Oncology Inc.",

Here, we report that merestinib inhibits neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinases NTRK1/2/3 which are oncogenic drivers in tumors bearing NTRK fusion resulting from chromosomal rearrangements. Merestinib is shown to be a type II NTRK1 kinase inhibitor as determined by x-ray crystallography.

BACKGROUND: Fusions involving one of three tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK) occur in diverse cancers in children and adults. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib, a highly selective TRK inhibitor, in adults and children who had tumors with these fusions. METHODS: We enrolled patients with consecutively and prospectively identified TRK fusion-positive cancers, detected by molecular profiling as routinely performed at each site, into one of three protocols: a phase 1 study involving adults, a phase 1-2 study involving children, or a phase 2 study involving adolescents and adults. The primary end point for the combined analysis was the overall response rate according to independent review. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients, ranging in age from 4 months to 76 years, were enrolled and treated. Patients had 17 unique TRK fusion-positive tumor types. The overall response rate was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61 to 85) according to independent review and 80% (95% CI, 67 to 90) according to investigator assessment. At 1 year, 71% of the responses were ongoing and 55% of the patients remained progression-free. The median duration of response and progression-free survival had not been reached. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, 86% of the patients with a response (38 of 44 patients) were continuing treatment or had undergone surgery that was intended to be curative. Adverse events were predominantly of grade 1, and no adverse event of grade 3 or 4 that was considered by the investigators to be related to larotrectinib occurred in more than 5% of patients. No patient discontinued larotrectinib owing to drug-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Larotrectinib had marked and durable antitumor activity in patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer, regardless of the age of the patient or of the tumor type.

Pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) are benign glial tumors and one of the most common childhood posterior fossa tumors. Spontaneous intratumoral hemorrhage in PAs occurs occasionally, in about 8-20% of cases. Cerebellar hemorrhages in pediatric population are rare and mainly due to head injuries, rupture of vascular malformations, infections, or hematological diseases. We have investigated the still controversial and unclear pathophysiology underlying intratumoral hemorrhage in PAs. Bleeding in low-grade tumors might be related to structural abnormalities and specific angio-architecture of tumor vessels, such as degenerative mural hyalinization, \"glomeruloid\" endothelial proliferation, presence of encased micro-aneurysms, and glioma-induced neoangiogenesis. The acute hemorrhagic presentation of cerebellar PA in childhood although extremely uncommon is of critical clinical importance and necessitates promptly treatment. We described a case of hemorrhagic cerebellar PA in a 9-year-old child and reviewed the English-language literature that reported spontaneous hemorrhagic histologically proven cerebellar PA in pediatric patients (0-18\u00a0years). According to our analysis, the mortality was not related to symptom onset, tumor location, hemorrhage distribution, presence of acute hydrocephalous, and timing of surgery, while the GCS at hospital admission resulted to be the only statistically significant prognostic factor affecting survival outcome. The abrupt onset of signs and symptoms of acute hydrocephalous and consequent raised intracranial pressure are life-threatening conditions, which need emergent medical and neurosurgical treatments. At a later time, the identification of posterior fossa hemorrhage etiology is crucial to select the appropriate treatment and address the surgical strategy, optimizing the postoperative results.",

Consequently, parallel research efforts have been focused on identifying the underlying genetic and biological basis of pediatric HGG in order to more clearly define prognostic subgroups for treatment stratification as well as identify new treatment targets. These cutting-edge advances have revolutionized pediatric neuro-oncology and have revealed novel oncogenic vulnerabilities that are being therapeutically leveraged. Promising treatments - including pathway-targeting small molecules as well as epigenetic therapy - are being evaluated in clinical trials, and recent genomic discoveries in rare glioma subgroups have led to the identification of additional new potentially-actionable alterations.

These may be roughly segregated into low-grade gliomas (WHO grades I or II; including most mixed glial-neuronal tumors) and high-grade gliomas (WHO grades III or IV) according to their clinical course when untreated, even though this is not yet entirely clear for some of the recently emerging groups.

Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors, of which glioblastoma is the most malignant form (WHO grade IV), and notorious for treatment resistance.

Most characteristic are mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in lower grade gliomas, and histone 3 mutations in pediatric high grade gliomas that are also associated with characteristic DNA methylation patterns. Furthermore, in adult glioblastoma patients epigenetic silencing of the DNA repair gene MGMT by promoter methylation is predictive for benefit from alkylating agent therapy. These epigenetic alterations are used as biomarkers and play a central role for classification of gliomas (WHO 2016) and treatment decisions. Here we review the pivotal role of epigenetic alterations in the etiology and biology of gliomas.

We identified distinct methylation profiles characterizing PAs from different locations (infratentorial vs supratentorial) and tumors with onset before and after 3 years of age. These results suggest that PA may be related to the specific brain site where the tumor arises from region-specific cells of origin.

OBJECTIVE: Although the majority of cases of cystic fibrosis (CF) are now diagnosed through newborn screening, there is still a need to standardize the diagnostic criteria for those diagnosed outside of the neonatal period. This is because newborn screening started relatively recently, it is not performed everywhere, and even for individuals who were screened, there is the possibility of a false negative. To limit irreversible organ pathology, a timely diagnosis of CF and institution of CF therapies can greatly benefit these patients. STUDY DESIGN: Experts on CF diagnosis were convened at the 2015 CF Foundation Diagnosis Consensus Conference. The participants reviewed and discussed published works and instructive cases of CF diagnosis in individuals presenting with signs, symptoms, or a family history of CF. Through a modified Delphi methodology, several consensus statements were agreed upon. These consensus statements were updates of prior CF diagnosis conferences and recommendations. RESULTS: CF diagnosis in individuals outside of newborn screening relies on the clinical evidence and on evidence of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction. Clinical evidence can include typical organ pathologies seen in CF such as bronchiectasis or pancreatic insufficiency but often represent a broad range of severity including mild cases. CFTR dysfunction can be demonstrated using sweat chloride testing, CFTR molecular genetic analysis, or CFTR physiologic tests. On the basis of the large number of patients with bona fide CF currently followed in registries with sweat chloride levels between 30 and 40 mmol/L, the threshold considered \"intermediate\" was lowered from 40 mmol/L in the prior diagnostic guidelines to 30 mmol/L. The CF diagnosis was also discussed in the context of CFTR-related disorders in which CFTR dysfunction may be present, but the individual does not meet criteria for CF. CONCLUSIONS: CF diagnosis remains a rare but important condition that can be diagnosed when characteristic clinical features are seen in an individual with demonstrated CFTR dysfunction.",

Objective: To conduct a descriptive analysis of the sweat test (ST), associating ST results with epidemiological data, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) mutations and reasons to indicate the ST, as well as correlating sweat sodium and sweat chloride concentrations in subjects. Methods: Retrospective survey and descriptive analysis of 5,721 ST at a university referral center. Results: The inclusion of the subjects was based on clinical data related with cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype. The samples were grouped by (i) sweat chloride concentrations (mEq/L): <30: 3,249/5,277 (61.6%); > 30 to <60: 1,326/5,277 (25.1%); > 60: 702/5,277 (13.3%) and (ii) age: (Group A--GA) 0 to <6 months; (Group B--GB) > 6 months to <18 years; (Group C--GC) > 18 years. Digestive symptoms showed higher prevalence ratio for the CF diagnosis as well as association between younger age and higher values of sweat chloride, sweat sodium, and chloride/sodium ratio. The indication of ST due to respiratory symptoms was higher in GB and associated with greater age, lower values of sweat chloride, sweat sodium, and chloride/sodium ratio. There was higher prevalence of ST with sweat chloride levels <30 mEq/L in GB, > 60 mEq/L in GC, and with borderline level in GB. There was positive correlation between sweat sodium and sweat chloride. Sweat chloride/sweat sodium and sweat sodium-sweat chloride indexes showed association with sex, reason for ST indication, and CFTR mutations. Sex alters some values presented in the ST. The number of ST/year performed before and after the newborn screening implementation was the same; however, we observed a higher number of borderlines values. A wide spectrum of CFTR mutation was found. Severe CFTR mutations and F508del/F508del genotype were associated with highest probability of ST chloride levels > 60 mEq/L, and the absence of CFTR mutations identified was associated with borderline ST and respiratory symptoms. Conclusions: ST data showed wide variability dependent on age, sex, reason for examination indication, CFTR mutations, and weight of the collected sweat sample.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex autosomal recessive disease that continues to present unique diagnostic challenges. Because CF was first described in 1938, there has been a substantial growth of genetic and phenotypic information about the disorder. During the past few years, as more evidence has become available, a consortium of international experts determined that the 2008 guidelines from the CF Foundation needed to be reviewed and updated. CONTENT: The goal of this review is to highlight the latest advances in CF multidisciplinary care, together with the recent updates to the 2017 CF Foundation diagnostic guidelines. SUMMARY: Data from newborn screening programs, patient registries, clinical databases, and functional research have led to a better understanding of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Recent consensus guidelines have provided recommendations for clinicians and laboratorians to better assist with interpretation of disease status and related CF mutations. The highly recommended Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR project should be the first resource in the evaluation of disease severity for CF mutations. Screen-positive newborns and patients with high clinical suspicion for CF are always recommended to undergo confirmatory sweat chloride testing with interpretations based on updated reference intervals. Every patient diagnosed with CF should receive genotyping, as novel molecular therapies are becoming standard of practice.

BACKGROUND: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutation identification is being used with increased frequency to aid in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in those suspected with CF. Aim of this study was to identify diagnostic outcomes when CFTR mutational analysis was used in CF diagnosis. CFTR mutational analysis results were also compared with sweat chloride results. METHODS: This study was done on all patients at our institution who had CFTR mutation analysis over a sevenyear period since August 2006. RESULTS: A total of 315 patients underwent CFTR mutational analysis. Fifty-one (16.2%) patients had two mutations identified. Among them 32 had positive sweat chloride levels ( > 60 mmol/L), while seven had borderline sweat chloride levels (40-59 mmol/L). An additional 70 patients (22.3%) had only one mutation identified. Among them eight had positive sweat chloride levels, and 17 had borderline sweat chloride levels. Fifty-five patients (17.5%) without CFTR mutations had either borderline (n=45) or positive (n=10) sweat chloride results. Three patients with a CF phenotype had negative CFTR analysis but elevated sweat chloride levels. In eighty-three patients (26.4%) CFTR mutational analysis was done without corresponding sweat chloride testing. CONCLUSIONS: Although CFTR mutation analysis has improved the diagnostic capability for CF, its use either as the first step or the only test to diagnose CFTR dysfunction should be discouraged and CF diagnostic guidelines need to be followed.",

The sweat chloride test remains the gold standard for confirmatory diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in support of universal newborn screening programs. However, it provides ambiguous results for intermediate sweat chloride cases while not reflecting disease progression when classifying the complex CF disease spectrum given the pleiotropic effects of gene modifiers and environment. Herein we report the first characterization of the sweat metabolome from screen-positive CF infants and identify metabolites associated with disease status that complement sweat chloride testing. Pilocarpine-stimulated sweat specimens were collected independently from two CF clinics, including 50 unaffected infants (e.g., carriers) and 18 confirmed CF cases. Nontargeted metabolite profiling was performed using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry as a high throughput platform for analysis of polar/ionic metabolites in volume-restricted sweat samples. Amino acids, organic acids, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, purine derivatives, and unknown exogenous compounds were identified in sweat when using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, including metabolites associated with affected yet asymptomatic CF infants, such as asparagine and glutamine. Unexpectedly, a metabolite of pilocarpine, used to stimulate sweat secretion, pilocarpic acid, and a plasticizer metabolite from environmental exposure, mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalic acid, were secreted in the sweat of CF infants at significantly lower concentrations relative to unaffected CF screen-positive controls. These results indicated a deficiency in human paraoxonase, an enzyme unrelated to mutations to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and impaired chloride transport, which is a nonspecific arylesterase/lactonase known to mediate inflammation, bacterial biofilm formation, and recurrent lung infections in affected CF children later in life. This work sheds new light into the underlying mechanisms of CF pathophysiology as required for new advances in precision medicine of orphan diseases that benefit from early detection and intervention, including new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.",

BACKGROUND: Sweat chloride testing for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) involves sweat induction, collection and handling, and measurement in an analytical lab. We have developed a wearable sensor with an integrated salt bridge for real-time measurement of sweat chloride concentration. Here, in a proof-of-concept study, we compare the performance of the sensor to current clinical practice in CF patients and healthy subjects. METHOD: Sweat was induced on both forearms of 10 individuals with CF and 10 healthy subjects using pilocarpine iontophoresis. A Macroduct sweat collection device was attached to one arm and sweat was collected for 30 min and then sent for laboratory analysis. A sensor was attached to the other arm and the chloride ion concentration monitored in real time for 30 min using a Bluetooth transceiver and smart phone app. RESULTS: Stable sweat chloride measurements were obtained within 15 min following sweat induction using the wearable sensor. We define the detection time as the time at which the standard deviation of the real-time chloride ion concentration remained below 2 mEq/L for 5 min. The sweat volume for sensor measurements at the detection time was 13.1 \u00b1 11.4 \u03bcL (SD), in many cases lower than the minimum sweat volume of 15 \u03bcL for conventional testing. The mean difference between sweat chloride concentrations measured by the sensor and the conventional laboratory practice was 6.2 \u00b1 9.5 mEq/L (SD), close to the arm-to-arm variation of about 3 mEq/L. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two measurements was 0.97 highlighting the excellent agreement between the two methods. CONCLUSION: A wearable sensor can be used to make real-time measurements of sweat chloride within 15 min following sweat induction, requiring a small sweat volume, and with excellent agreement to standard methods.",

Fecal microbiota transplantation is a highly effective intervention for patients suffering from recurrent Clostridium difficile, a common hospital-acquired infection. Fecal microbiota transplantation's success as a therapy for C. difficile has inspired interest in performing clinical trials that experiment with fecal microbiota transplantation as a therapy for other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. Results from clinical trials that use fecal microbiota transplantation to treat inflammatory bowel disease suggest that, for at least one condition beyond C. difficile, most fecal microbiota transplantation donors produce stool that is not efficacious. The optimal strategies for identifying and using efficacious donors have not been investigated. We therefore examined the optimal Bayesian response-adaptive strategy for allocating patients to donors and formulated a computationally tractable myopic heuristic. This heuristic computes the probability that a donor is efficacious by updating prior expectations about the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation, the placebo rate, and the fraction of donors that produce efficacious stool. In simulations designed to mimic a recent fecal microbiota transplantation clinical trial, for which traditional power calculations predict [Formula: see text] statistical power, we found that accounting for differences in donor stool efficacy reduced the predicted statistical power to [Formula: see text]. For these simulations, using the heuristic Bayesian allocation strategy more than quadrupled the statistical power to [Formula: see text]. We use the results of similar simulations to make recommendations about the number of patients, the number of donors, and the choice of clinical endpoint that clinical trials should use to optimize their ability to detect if fecal microbiota transplantation is effective for treating a condition.",

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the asymptomatic Clostridium difficile carriage rates following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). METHODS: All patients who underwent FMT for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) via colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy between June 2013 and April 2015 and had a minimum of 8-week follow-up post FMT at two tertiary care referral centres were included in the study. Patients were prospectively followed both clinically and with stool assessments for 8\u00a0weeks post FMT. Assessments occurred at 1\u00a0week and 4\u00a0weeks post FMT to assess for failure. Failure was defined as presence of diarrhoeal symptoms and a positive CDI stool test by polymerase chain reaction for toxin gene (PCR) at any time point during the 8-week follow-up period. CDI stool testing using PCR was performed at weeks 1 and 4 post FMT in asymptomatic patients as well. RESULTS: 167 patients were included. Twenty-eight patients (16.7% (28/167)) were FMT failures throughout the 8-week period. At week 1, seven patients had already failed the FMT. Of the remaining 160 patients, 144 were asymptomatic, and among these, 141 were negative for C.\u00a0difficile toxin gene by PCR. This resulted in an asymptomatic carriage rate of 2.1% (3/144). At week 4, 143 patients had not yet failed FMT. Of these patients 129 patients were asymptomatic and among those, 125 were negative by PCR, resulting in an asymptomatic carriage rate of 3% (3/129). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic carriage after FMT is rare. This suggests that testing for cure after FMT in asymptomatic patients is not necessary.",

The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide is well established as a key player in the pathogenesis of migraine. Clinical studies show calcitonin gene-related peptide levels correlate with migraine attacks, and decreases in this neuropeptide can indicate antimigraine therapy effectiveness. Research has revealed a wide distribution of expression sites for calcitonin gene-related peptide in the central and peripheral nervous system. Of these, the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, which binds calcitonin gene-related peptide with high affinity, has attracted growing interest as a viable target for antimigraine therapies. An incentive to pursue such research is the continuing unmet medical need of patients. Triptans have offered some clinical benefit, but many patients do not respond and these drugs have important safety considerations. Initial calcitonin gene-related peptide-focused research led to development of the \"gepant\" small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blockers. Positive efficacy reports concerning the gepants have been tempered by safety findings which led to the discontinuation of some of these agents. Currently, there is considerable excitement regarding monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab). To date, these monoclonal antibodies have shown promising efficacy in clinical trials, with no major safety concerns.

RECENT FINDINGS: The efficacy data from Phase 2 trials are corroborated by those from published Phase 3 trials, with a multitude of publications expected in 2018. Review of safety data concluded there was no difference in total adverse events or main adverse events (including upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, nausea, injection-site pain and back pain) between the mAbs and placebo injections except apparently for dizziness. The site of action of these mAbs is not fully elucidated but current insight is that their effect resides in the periphery; a contribution of central effect(s) can however not be excluded at present. SUMMARY: Although efficacy of all four drugs is modest over placebo in episodic and chronic migraine prevention and overall comparable with available oral preventive treatments, current tolerability and (short-term) safety data of this new treatment approach certainly promise a major step forward for migraine patients.",

The database interface supports the user-friendly capability of browsing and searching the SNVs and their annotation information. DSMNC, which serves as a timely and valuable collection of somatic mutations in individual normal cells, has made it possible to analyze the burdens and signatures of somatic mutations in various types of heterogeneous normal cells.

The past three decades have witnessed remarkable advances in our ability to target specific elements of the immune and inflammatory response, fuelled by advances in both biotechnology and disease knowledge. As well as providing superior treatments for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such therapies also offer unrivalled opportunities to study the underlying immunopathological basis of these conditions.In this review, we explore recent approaches to the treatment of IMIDs and the insights to pathobiology that they provide. We review novel biologic agents targeting the T-helper 17 axis, including therapies directed towards interleukin (IL)-17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab), IL-17R (brodalumab), IL-12/23p40 (ustekinumab, briakinumab) and IL-23p19 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab, brazikumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Upadacitinib is a janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory diseases. This work characterized upadacitinib population pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and RA patients and the effects of covariates on upadacitinib exposure. METHODS: Upadacitinib plasma concentrations (n\u00a0=\u00a06399) from 107 healthy subjects and 466 RA patients from three phase\u00a0I and two 12-week RA phase\u00a0IIb trials (1-48\u00a0mg immediate-release doses across studies) were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. The models were qualified using bootstrap and stochastic simulations. RESULTS: A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination described upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. Estimates (95% bootstrap confidence interval) for upadacitinib oral clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, absorption lag time, and mean absorption time were 39.7 (37.8-41.5)\u00a0L/h, 210 (196-231)\u00a0L, 0.48 (0.47-0.49)\u00a0h, and 0.08 (0.04-0.12)\u00a0h, respectively, for a typical healthy male. Matching on other covariates, a 16 and 32% higher upadacitinib area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was estimated for females relative to males, and for subjects with RA relative to healthy volunteers, respectively. Subjects with RA with mild or moderate renal impairment were estimated to have 16 and 32% higher upadacitinib AUC, respectively, compared with subjects with RA with normal renal function. Upadacitinib clearance was not correlated with body weight. CONCLUSIONS: Upadacitinib pharmacokinetics follow dose-proportional, bi-exponential disposition. A slightly lower upadacitinib clearance is estimated in subjects with RA than in healthy volunteers, consistent with observations for other JAK inhibitors. Other covariates (weight, sex, mild or moderate renal impairment) are not associated with clinically relevant effects on upadacitinib exposure.

BACKGROUND: There is a great unmet clinical need for efficacious, tolerable, economical and orally administrated drugs for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). New therapeutic avenues have become possible including the development of medications that target specific genetic pathways found to be relevant in other immune mediated diseases. AIMS: To provide an overview of recent clinical trials for new generation oral targeted medications that may have a future role in IBD management. METHODS: Pubmed and Medline searches were performed up to 1 March 2018 using keywords: \"IBD\", \"UC\", \"CD\", \"inflammatory bowel disease\" \"ulcerative colitis\", \"Crohn's disease\" in combination with \"phase\", \"study\", \"trial\" and \"oral\". A manual search of the clinical trial register, article reference lists, abstracts from meetings of Digestive Disease Week, United European Gastroenterology Week and ECCO congress were also conducted. RESULTS: In randomised controlled trials primary efficacy endpoints were met for tofacitinib (JAK 1/3 inhibitor-phase III), upadacitinib (JAK 1 inhibitor-phase II) and AJM300 (\u03b14-integrin antagonist-phase II) in ulcerative colitis. Ozanimod (S1P receptor agonist-phase II) also demonstrated clinical remission. For Crohn's disease, filgotinib (JAK1 inhibitor-phase II) met primary endpoints and laquinimod (quinolone-3-carboxide small molecule-phase II) was also efficacious. Trials using mongersen (SMAD7 inhibitor) and vidofludimus (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor) have been halted. CONCLUSIONS: This is potentially the start of an exciting new era in which multiple therapeutic options are at the disposal of physicians to treat IBD on an individualised basis.

PURPOSE: CLAPO syndrome is a rare vascular disorder characterized by capillary malformation of the lower lip, lymphatic malformation predominant on the face and neck, asymmetry, and partial/generalized overgrowth. Here we tested the hypothesis that, although the genetic cause is not known, the tissue distribution of the clinical manifestations in CLAPO seems to follow a pattern of somatic mosaicism. METHODS: We clinically evaluated a cohort of 13 patients with CLAPO and screened 20 DNA blood/tissue samples from 9 patients using high-throughput, deep sequencing. RESULTS: We identified five activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene in affected tissues from 6 of the 9 patients studied; one of the variants (NM_006218.2:c.248T>C; p.Phe83Ser) has not been previously described in developmental disorders. CONCLUSION: We describe for the first time the presence of somatic activating PIK3CA mutations in patients with CLAPO. We also report an update of the phenotype and natural history of the syndrome.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We describe recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-targeting agents. RECENT FINDINGS: Five targeted drugs are currently available in the clinic via regular approval or named patient programs, including crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib. Further drugs are tested in clinical trials. This review summarizes published data, together with drug-specific information on dosing and toxicity. Moreover, we discuss different clinical scenarios and potential treatment options in patients with tumor progression, based on current literature and our own experience. SUMMARY: Patients with metastatic, anaplastic lymphoma kinase-rearranged nonsmall cell lung cancer should be managed by interdisciplinary expert teams. New drugs with enhanced brain activity are available, and some patients may benefit from local therapies.",

IMPORTANCE: The identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in 2-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients led to the rapid clinical development of its oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Crizotinib was the first ALK inhibitor approved and utilised in the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC patients in the second line setting first and subsequently in the first line one. Since then many other ALK inhibitors have been developed (ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib,etc) and the treatment paradigm of these patients has considerably drifted. The questions regarding their treatment at progression remains unanswered at the moment. OBJECTIVE: Our review clarifies what it is the state of the art in the treatment of ALK rearranged NSCLC patients, highlights the mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance mutations and suggests a treatment algorithm based on specific primary resistance or acquired mutations. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Studies that enrolled ALK+ NSCLC patients with locally advance or metastatic disease receiving treatment with ALK inhibitor, first or second line, were identified using electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library). Trials were excluded if they were phase 1, enrolled less than 10 patients. FINDING: Overall 1942 patients were included in our review. It confirms the role and the efficacy in first line of Alectinib but it highlights also that all the ALK inhibitors could play a crucial role during the patients' journey. Identifying the different mutations and utilising the most active ALK inhibitor depending on the \"up-to-date\" driven mutation is the way forward in the management of those patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: the review shows the rapid drifting in the management of ALK+ NSCLC patients and the importance of fully understanding and acknowledging the role of the resistance mutation, primary or acquired. We strongly advocate a comprehensive genomic approach in the management of ALK+ NSCLC patients who develop resistance mutations that are still targetable by a different ALK inhibitor.",

Purpose Advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are effectively treated with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, clinical outcomes in these patients vary, and the benefit of TKIs is limited as a result of acquired resistance. Emerging data suggest that the ALK fusion variant may affect clinical outcome, but the molecular basis for this association is unknown. Patients and Methods We identified 129 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with known ALK variants. ALK resistance mutations and clinical outcomes on ALK TKIs were retrospectively evaluated according to ALK variant. A Foundation Medicine data set of 577 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC was also examined. Results The most frequent ALK variants were EML4-ALK variant 1 in 55 patients (43%) and variant 3 in 51 patients (40%). We analyzed 77 tumor biopsy specimens from patients with variants 1 and 3 who had progressed on an ALK TKI. ALK resistance mutations were significantly more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (57% v 30%; P = .023). In particular, ALK G1202R was more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (32% v 0%; P < .001). Analysis of the Foundation Medicine database revealed similar associations of variant 3 with ALK resistance mutation and with G1202R ( P = .010 and .015, respectively). Among patients treated with the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib, variant 3 was associated with a significantly longer progression-free survival than variant 1 (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.79; P = .011). Conclusion Specific ALK variants may be associated with the development of ALK resistance mutations, particularly G1202R, and provide a molecular link between variant and clinical outcome. ALK variant thus represents a potentially important factor in the selection of next-generation ALK inhibitors.",

Purpose: ALK rearrangements predict for sensitivity to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, responses to ALK TKIs are generally short-lived. Serial molecular analysis is an informative strategy for identifying genetic mediators of resistance. Although multiple studies support the clinical benefits of repeat tissue sampling, the clinical utility of longitudinal circulating tumor DNA analysis has not been established in ALK-positive lung cancer. Methods: Using a 566-gene hybrid-capture next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, we performed longitudinal analysis of plasma specimens from 22 ALK-positive patients with acquired resistance to ALK TKIs to track the evolution of resistance during treatment. To determine tissue-plasma concordance, we compared plasma findings to results of repeat biopsies. Results: At progression, we detected an ALK fusion in plasma from 19 (86%) of 22 patients, and identified ALK resistance mutations in plasma specimens from 11 (50%) patients. There was 100% agreement between tissue- and plasma-detected ALK fusions. Among 16 cases where contemporaneous plasma and tissue specimens were available, we observed 100% concordance between ALK mutation calls. ALK mutations emerged and disappeared during treatment with sequential ALK TKIs, suggesting that plasma mutation profiles were dependent on the specific TKI administered. ALK G1202R, the most frequent plasma mutation detected after progression on a second-generation TKI, was consistently suppressed during treatment with lorlatinib. Conclusions: Plasma genotyping by NGS is an effective method for detecting ALK fusions and ALK mutations in patients progressing on ALK TKIs. The correlation between plasma ALK mutations and response to distinct ALK TKIs highlights the potential for plasma analysis to guide selection of ALK-directed therapies.",

BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a validated molecular target in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical benefits of ALK inhibitors are almost universally limited by the emergence of drug resistance. METHODS: We monitored the plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using captured-based ultra-deep sequencing analysis of one patient with metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC who had received therapies including first-, second- and third-generation ALK inhibitors. Functional in vitro studies were further undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of resistance. RESULTS: ALK T1151Sins mutation was detected when the patient developed resistance to ceritinib, and undetectable when she responded to lorlatinib. MET amplification was present when the tumor developed resistance to lorlatinib, and reduced when the patient received combination therapy of lorlatinib with crizotinib, which corresponded to clinical radiologic responses. In addition, further functional in vitro studies demonstrated that ALK harboring the T1151Sins mutation, while conferring resistance to ceritinib, was inhibited by lorlatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical evidence and in vitro validation revealed the clinical usefulness of captured-base ultra-deep sequencing on longitudinal plasma ctDNA in revealing the underlying resistance mechanism and guiding the precise administration of ALK inhibitors in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.",

BACKGROUND: The genetic cause of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) carries prognostic information. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a whole-genome sequencing study assessing a large proportion of the NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases cohort. METHODS: In the predominantly European study population of principally sporadic unrelated PID cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0846), a novel Bayesian method identified nuclear factor \u03baB subunit 1 (NFKB1) as one of the genes most strongly associated with PID, and the association was explained by 16 novel heterozygous truncating, missense, and gene deletion variants. This accounted for 4% of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0390) in the cohort. Amino acid substitutions predicted to be pathogenic were assessed by means of analysis of structural protein data. Immunophenotyping, immunoblotting, and ex\u00a0vivo stimulation of lymphocytes determined the functional effects of these variants. Detailed clinical and pedigree information was collected for genotype-phenotype cosegregation analyses. RESULTS: Both sporadic and familial cases demonstrated evidence of the noninfective complications of CVID, including massive lymphadenopathy (24%), unexplained splenomegaly (48%), and autoimmune disease (48%), features prior studies correlated with worse clinical prognosis. Although partial penetrance of clinical symptoms was noted in certain pedigrees, all carriers have a deficiency in B-lymphocyte differentiation. Detailed assessment of B-lymphocyte numbers, phenotype, and function identifies the presence of an increased CD21 B-cell population. Combined with identification of the disease-causing variant, this distinguishes between healthy subjects, asymptomatic carriers, and clinically affected cases. CONCLUSION: We show that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of CVID, which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing B cells.",
