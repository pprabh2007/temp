Olive leaves are rich in polyphenolic compounds that are known to have antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, olive leaf extract (OLE) is considered as a natural supplement. In this study we evaluated the antibacterial and the anti-inflammatory effect of OLE and its individual phenolic components in vitro. Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNCs) were isolated from the whole blood using Histopaque solution and cultured in RPMI-enriched medium. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) level was determined by ELISA after 24 h of lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The antibacterial activity of OLE was determined by well diffusion assay. We found a significant decrease in TNF\u03b1 secretion level in PMNCs culture treated with OLE. Oleuropein is the only OLE component that has shown anti-inflammatory effects at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/mL. Furthermore, OLE exhibited antibacterial activity against some gram positive bacterial strains; however, gram negative bacterial strains were resistant to OLE. Downregulation of TNF\u03b1 secretion in PMNCs culture in response to OLE treatment indicates that this polyphenol-rich extract has an anti-inflammatory effect, and oleuropein is the major OLE component responsible for this effect. The antibacterial activity of OLE is limited to gram positive bacteria.",

Eosinophilic asthma is characterized by the eosinophilic inflammation with the allergen independent activation of Th2 lymphocytes. Since IL-5 plays an important role in the maturation, survival and migration of eosinophils, hence the pathogenesis of eosinophilic asthma, biotherapeutics targeting IL-5/IL-5R\u03b1 have been developed and/or marketed, including Mepolizumab, Reslizumab, and Benralizumab. Accurate determination of bioactivity is crucial for the safety and efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. The current mode of action (MOA) based method used in the quality control and stability tests for anti-IL-5 mAbs is anti-proliferation assay, which is tedious with long duration and high variation. We describe here the development and validation of a reporter gene assay (RGA), based on an IL-5-dependent TF-1 cell line variant we established that stably expresses the luciferase reporter under the control of STAT5 response elements. After careful optimization, we demonstrate the excellent specificity, precision, accuracy and linearity of the established RGA. Our study also proves that the assay is superior on precision, sensitivity and assay simplicity to the anti-proliferation assay. The established RGA is also applicable to another anti-IL-5R\u03b1 mAb. These results show for the first time that this novel RGA, based on the IL-5-IL-5R-STAT5 pathway, can be a valuable supplement to the anti-proliferation assay and employed in the bioactivity determination of anti-IL-5/anti-IL-5R\u03b1 biotherapeutics.",

Cation homeostasis, in relation to various immune-suppressive diseases, is a novel field of investigation. Recently, patients with a loss-of-function mutation in magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1) were reported to present a dysregulated Mg homeostasis in T lymphocytes. Using Magt1-knockout mice (Magt1 ), we show that Mg homeostasis was impaired in Magt1 B cells and Ca influx was increased after BCR stimulation, whereas T and NK cell function was unaffected. Consequently, mutant B cells displayed an increased phosphorylation of BCR-related proteins differentially affecting protein kinase C activation. These in vitro findings translated into increased frequencies of CD19 B cells and marginal zone B cells and decreased frequencies of plasma cells among CD45 splenocytes in vivo. Altogether, our study demonstrates for the first time, to our knowledge, that abolished MAGT1 function causes imbalanced cation homeostasis and developmental responses in B cells.

However, the precise mechanisms by which p300 expression is regulated remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of miR-150, a potential p300-targeting microRNA (miRNA), in the post-transcriptional control of p300 expression and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by high glucose. We observed that the expression of miR-150 was significantly reduced, whereas the expression of p300 was strongly elevated, concomitant with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, in the hearts of diabetic rats compared with normal controls. Similar alterations were observed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes that had been exposed to high levels of glucose. miR-150 mimics inhibited p300 3'-UTR luciferase reporter activity, as well as endogenous p300 expression. In addition, miR-150 mimics prevented glucose-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Co-transfection with a p300 expression vector and miR-150 mimics reversed the protective effect of miR-150 on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We further showed that the high glucose-mediated activation of PKC\u03b2(2) in turn mediated the down-regulation of miR-150 expression. These data demonstrated a novel upstream role for miR-150 in p300-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and revealed a previously uncharacterized miRNAs and HATs cross-talk mechanism for the hypertrophic phenotype induced by high glucose.",

Here we show that the activation of p300 directly depends on the activation and oligomerization status of transcription factor ligands. Using two model transcription factors, IRF3 and STAT1, we demonstrate that transcription factor dimerization enables the trans-autoacetylation of p300 in a highly conserved and intrinsically disordered autoinhibitory lysine-rich loop, resulting in p300 activation. We describe a crystal structure of p300 in which the autoinhibitory loop invades the active site of a neighbouring HAT domain, revealing a snapshot of a trans-autoacetylation reaction intermediate. Substrate access to the active site involves the rearrangement of an autoinhibitory RING domain. Our data explain how cellular signalling and the activation and dimerization of transcription factors control the activation of p300, and therefore explain why gene transcription is associated with chromatin acetylation.",

(ironwort, mountain tea), an endemic plant of the Balkan Peninsula, has been used in traditional medicine in the treatment of gastrointestinal complaints, inflammation, and rheumatic disorders. This study aimed to evaluate its gastroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities. Besides, continuously increasing interest in assessing the role of the plant active constituents preventing the risk of cancer was a reason to make a detailed examination of the investigated ethanol, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and N-butanol extracts regarding cytotoxicity. Oral administration of the investigated extracts caused a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in a model of carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. Gastroprotective activity of the extracts was investigated using an ethanol-induced acute stress ulcer in rats. The cytotoxic activity of plant extracts was assessed on PBMC, B16, and HL-60 cells and compared to the cytotoxicity of phenolic compounds identified in extracts. Apoptotic and necrotic cell death were analyzed by double staining with fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V and PI. The developed HPLC method enabled qualitative fingerprint analysis of phenolic compounds in the investigated extracts. Compared to the effect of the positive control, the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacine (4 mg/kg), which produced a 50 % decrease in inflammation, diethyl ether and N-butanol extracts exhibited about the same effect in doses of 200 and 100 mg/kg (53.6 and 48.7 %; 48.4 and 49.9 %, respectively). All investigated extracts produced dose-dependent gastroprotective activity with the efficacy comparable to that of the reference drug ranitidine. The diethyl ether extract showed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity on B16 cells and HL-60 cells, decreasing cell growth to 51.3 % and 77.5 % of control, respectively, when used at 100 \u00b5g/mL. It seems that phenolic compounds (apigenin, luteolin, and their corresponding glycosides) are responsible for the diethyl ether extract cytotoxic effect. It also appears that induction of oxidative stress might be involved in its cytotoxicity, since B16 and HL-60 cells increased their ROS production in response to treatment with diethyl ether extract. Neither of the tested extracts nor any phenolic compounds showed significant cytotoxic effect to human PBMC.

We found GBT inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis with the IC50 values <50 nM. Mechanistic studies using functional approaches identified GBT as an inhibitor of c-Myc. Further analysis showed that GBT especially evoked the ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc protein, thereby globally repressing the expression of c-Myc target genes. GBT treatment inhibited ERK and AKT signals, while stimulating the activation of JNK cascade. An E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, WWP2, was upregulated following JNK activation and played an important role in c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation through direct protein-protein interaction.

As a result, the reference characteristic chromatogram was established, displaying serotonin, gamabufotalin, arenobufagin, hellebrigenin, telocinobufagin, bufotalin, cinobufotalin, bufalin, cinobufagin and resibufogenin as characteristic peaks.

Compounds were detected both after inducing skin gland secretions and in constitutive mucosal rinses from toads. We described the antimicrobial properties of each bufadienolide against Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an amphibian fungal pathogen linked with boreal toad population declines. All three bufadienolides were found to inhibit Bd growth at similar levels. The maximum Bd inhibition produced by arenobufagin, gamabufotalin, and telocinobufagin were approximately 50%, in contrast to the complete Bd inhibition shown by antimicrobial skin peptides produced by some amphibian species. In addition, skin mucus samples significantly reduced Bd viability, and bufadienolides were detected in 15 of 62 samples. Bufadienolides also appeared to enhance growth of the anti-Bd bacterium Janthinobacterium lividum, and thus may be involved in regulation of the skin microbiome. Here, we localized skin bacteria within the mucus layer and granular glands of toads with fluorescent in situ hybridization. Overall, our results suggest that bufadienolides can function in antifungal defense on amphibian skin and their production is a potentially convergent trait similar to antimicrobial peptide defenses found on the skin of other species.

BACKGROUND: Gamabufotalin (CS-6), a major bufadienolide of Chansu, has been used for cancer therapy due to its desirable metabolic stability and less adverse effect. However, the underlying mechanism of CS-6 involved in anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood. METHODS: The biological functions of gamabufotalin (CS-6) were investigated by migration, colony formation and apoptosis assays in NSCLC cells. The nuclear localization and interaction between transcriptional co-activator p300 and NF-\u03baB p50/p65 and their binding to COX-2 promoter were analyzed after treatment with CS-6. Molecular docking study was used to simulate the interaction of CS-6 with IKK\u03b2. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of CS-6 was also analyzed in xenografts nude mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression level. RESULTS: Gamabufotalin (CS-6) strongly suppressed COX-2 expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b2 via targeting the ATP-binding site, thereby abrogating NF-\u03baB binding and p300 recruitment to COX-2 promoter. In addition, CS-6 induced apoptosis by activating the cytochrome c and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Moreover, CS-6 markedly down-regulated the protein levels of COX-2 and phosphorylated p65 NF-\u03baB in tumor tissues of the xenograft mice, and inhibited tumor weight and size.

BACKGROUND: Mitochondria of opisthokonts undergo permanent fission and fusion throughout the cell cycle. Here, we investigated the dynamics of the mitosomes, the simplest forms of mitochondria, in the anaerobic protist parasite Giardia intestinalis, a member of the Excavata supergroup of eukaryotes. The mitosomes have abandoned typical mitochondrial traits such as the mitochondrial genome and aerobic respiration and their single role known to date is the formation of iron-sulfur clusters. RESULTS: In live experiments, no fusion events were observed between the mitosomes in G. intestinalis. Moreover, the organelles were highly prone to becoming heterogeneous. This suggests that fusion is either much less frequent or even absent in mitosome dynamics. Unlike in mitochondria, division of the mitosomes was absolutely synchronized and limited to mitosis. The association of the nuclear and the mitosomal division persisted during the encystation of the parasite. During the segregation of the divided mitosomes, the subset of the organelles between two G. intestinalis nuclei had a prominent role. Surprisingly, the sole dynamin-related protein of the parasite seemed not to be involved in mitosomal division. However, throughout the cell cycle, mitosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), although none of the known ER-tethering complexes was present. Instead, the ER-mitosome interface was occupied by the lipid metabolism enzyme long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first report on the dynamics of mitosomes. We show that together with the loss of metabolic complexity of mitochondria, mitosomes of G. intestinalis have uniquely streamlined their dynamics by harmonizing their division with mitosis. We propose that this might be a strategy of G. intestinalis to maintain a stable number of organelles during cell propagation. The lack of mitosomal fusion may also be related to the secondary reduction of the organelles. However, as there are currently no reports on mitochondrial fusion in the whole Excavata supergroup, it is possible that the absence of mitochondrial fusion is an ancestral trait common to all excavates.",

However, our previous proteomic study of isolated phagosomes suggested that PNT is localized to organelles other than mitosomes. An immunofluorescence assay using anti-E. histolytica PNT (EhPNT) antibody raised against the NADH-binding domain showed a distribution to the membrane of numerous vesicles/vacuoles, including lysosomes and phagosomes. The domain(s) required for the trafficking of PNT to vesicles/vacuoles was examined by using amoeba transformants expressing a series of carboxyl-terminally truncated PNTs fused with green fluorescent protein or a hemagglutinin tag. All truncated PNTs failed to reach vesicles/vacuoles and were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These data indicate that the putative targeting signal is not sufficient for the trafficking of PNT to the vesicular/vacuolar compartments and that full-length PNT is necessary for correct transport. PNT displayed a smear of >120 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels. PNGase F and tunicamycin treatment, chemical degradation of carbohydrates, and heat treatment of PNT suggested that the apparent aberrant mobility of PNT is likely attributable to its hydrophobic nature. PNT that is compartmentalized to the acidic compartments is unprecedented in eukaryotes and may possess a unique physiological role in E. histolytica.",

Transport of proteins via TIM complexes, composed of three proteins of the Tim17 protein family (Tim17/22/23), is one of the key unifying aspects of mitochondria and mitochondria-derived organelles. However, multiple experimental and bioinformatic attempts have so far failed to identify the nature of TIM in mitosomes of the anaerobic metamonad protist, Giardia intestinalis, one of the few experimental models for mitosome biology. Here, we present the identification of a single G. intestinalis Tim17 protein (GiTim17), made possible only by the implementation of a metamonad-specific hidden Markov model. While very divergent in primary sequence and in predicted membrane topology, experimental data suggest that GiTim17 is an inner membrane mitosomal protein, forming a disulphide-linked dimer. We suggest that the peculiar GiTim17 sequence reflects adaptation to the unusual, detergent resistant, inner mitosomal membrane. Specific pull-down experiments indicate interaction of GiTim17 with mitosomal Tim44, the tethering component of the import motor complex. Analysis of TIM complexes across eukaryote diversity suggests that a \"single Tim\" translocase is a convergent adaptation of mitosomes in anaerobic protists, with Tim22 and Tim17 (but not Tim23), providing the protein backbone.",

At the time of the writing of this article, there are two CAR T cells available, Kymriah, produced by Novrtis with a price tag of US$475,000 and Yescarta produced by Gilead Pharmaceuticals with a price tag of US$373,000, neither price including the required hospital admission in order to administer the agent in addition to potential treatment of side effects. There are several issues that are imperative to recognize when understanding the high cost, however the two more pertinent issues are low availability of the agent and no billing code. While only approved for less than a year, there are thoughts about how to bring the price down with more approved CAR T cells and more center with the ability to administer this therapy, however results may be years away before they are realized. In the short term, insurance companies are grappling over how to pay for CAR T therapy, with one of the biggest voids concerning the absence of a billing code for CAR T cells. Regardless, its high price tag highlights moral issues underlying value-based payments and whether the treatment is worth the cost while evaluating the juxtaposition of life years and monetary values. As CAR T cells expand the boundaries of immunotherapy with extraordinary results, the need for a lower price in combination for more availability of CAR T cells will grow until some of these fundamental issues are addressed.",

The flavoenzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the fourth reaction of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, which exerts vital functions in the cells, especially within DNA and RNA biosynthesis. Thus, this enzyme stands out as a new key molecular target for parasites causing Neglected Diseases (NDs). Focused on contributing to the development of new therapeutic alternatives for NDs, in this study, for the first time, a screening of 57 natural products for in\u00a0vitro inhibition of Leishmania major DHODH (LmDHODH) was carried out, including cross validation against the human DHODH (HsDHODH). A subset of natural products consisting of 21 sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) was submitted to QSAR studies. Additionally, thermostability studies by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) were performed to determine whether the STLs are effectively or not binding to the enzyme. The IC values against LmDHODH varied from 27 to 1200 \u03bcM; only irrelevant inhibition was obtained on HsDHODH. DSF assays confirmed binding of STLs to LmDHODH; moreover, it is suggested that such inhibitors might act in a different site other than the active site. A reliable QSAR model based on molecular descriptors was obtained (R: 0.83; Q: 0.69 and Q: 0.66) indicating that stronger inhibition requires a balanced distribution of the hydrophobic regions across the molecular surface, as well as higher width and lower hydrophobicity of the molecules. A pharmacophore-based 3D-QSAR approach also afforded a useful model (R: 0.72; Q: 0.50 and Q: 0.62), which confirmed the importance of proper orientation of the ligands, molecular surface features and shape for stronger inhibition, reflecting properties of a putative common binding site. These data indicated for the first time that natural products can actually inhibit LmDHODH and highlighted some metabolites as potentially interesting starting points for the discovery of more potent LmDHODH inhibitors, ultimately aiming at new effective therapeutic alternatives for leishmaniasis and, possibly, other NDs caused by trypanosomatids.",

In Toxoplasma gondii, disruption of the first, fifth, or sixth step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis induced uracil auxotrophy. However, previous attempts to generate uracil auxotrophy by genetically deleting the mitochondrion-associated DHODH of T. gondii (TgDHODH) failed. To further address the essentiality of TgDHODH, mutant gene alleles deficient in TgDHODH activity were designed to ablate the enzyme activity. Replacement of the endogenous DHODH gene with catalytically deficient DHODH gene alleles induced uracil auxotrophy. Catalytically deficient TgDHODH localized to the mitochondria, and parasites retained mitochondrial membrane potential. These results show that TgDHODH is essential for the synthesis of pyrimidines and suggest that TgDHODH is required for a second essential function independent of its role in pyrimidine biosynthesis.",

Interestingly, they showed selective and strong cytotoxicity to cancer cells cultured under microenvironment (hypoxia and nutrient-deprived) conditions. The selectivity ratio of 8 under this microenvironment show the most potent inhibition which was over 1000-fold higher compared to that under normal culture condition.

We report molecularly distinct phases of astrogliogenesis that exhibit stage- and lineage-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures with unique primed and active chromatin regions, thereby revealing regulatory elements and transcriptional programs underlying astrocyte generation and maturation. By searching for transcription factors that function at these elements, we identified NFIA and ATF3 as drivers of astrocyte differentiation from neural precursor cells while RUNX2 promotes astrocyte maturation.

Untreated frozen-thawed spermatozoa served as controls. The RSV-induced AMPK activation decreased the level of DNA fragmentation in comparison with the control (21.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92 vs. 22.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

Conversely, the inhibitory effect of CC on AMPK activity deteriorated the deleterious effects of cryopreservation on these parameters (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In conclusion, these results demonstrated the cryoprotective effect of the RSV-induced increase in AMPK activity on DNA integrity and key paternal transcripts of cryopreserved human spermatozoa.

Human sperm express two types of protamine: protamine 1 (P1) and the family of protamine 2 (P2) proteins, with P1 and P2 normally existing in a ratio of approximately 1:1. Both the elevation and reduction of this ratio have been linked with male infertility suggesting that abnormalities in protamine expression, processing and replacement may be responsible for effects on semen parameters observed in infertile males affected by deficient protamination, along with abnormalities in associated regulatory processes. Abnormal protamination may result in insufficient condensation in the sperm nucleus, thus rendering paternal DNA susceptible to damage, which could have detrimental consequences upon embryogenesis. Consequently, it is imperative that Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) endeavour to utilise sperm devoid of protamine abnormalities, especially because retained histones are present in imprinted gene clusters. Emerging evidence indicates that abnormalities in protamine content may influence epigenetic signals transmitted via paternal DNA. Indeed, an increase in rare imprinting disorders has been observed in children conceived via in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

We isolated primary epididymal epithelial cells from rat epididymides and verified their phenotype by detecting the presence of cytokeratin-19 (CK-19, an epithelial cell marker) and the absence vimentin (an interstitial cell marker). We found that cultured epididymal epithelial cells isolated from rat epididymides expressed high levels of CK-19 but barely expressed vimentin. Gain-of-function assays, which included the CCK-8 assay and EdU flow cytometry assay, indicated that overexpression of OCTN2 significantly promoted epididymal epithelial cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, forced expression of OCTN2 inhibited the cell apoptosis process, and at the same time increased expression of the pro-apoptosis factor BAX, and decreased expression of the anti-apoptosis factors BCL-2 and Survivin. Furthermore, we also found that OCTN2 overexpression dramatically increased the levels of biomarkers associated with spermatogenesis, including azoospermia-like (DAZL), phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2), and protamine 2 (PRM2).

Their function is strongly linked to sperm head morphology and male fertility. Protamines appear to be affected by a complex pattern of selective constraints. Previous studies showed that sexual selection affects protamine coding sequence and expression in rodents. Here we analyze selective constraints and post-copulatory sexual selection acting on protamine 2 (Prm2) gene sequences of 53 species of primates and rodents. We focused on possible differences in selective constraints between these two clades and on the two functional domains of PRM2 (cleaved- and mature-PRM2). We also assessed if and how changes in Prm2 coding sequence may affect sperm head dimensions. RESULTS: The domain of Prm2 that is cleaved off during binding to DNA (cleaved-Prm2) was found to be under purifying selection in both clades, whereas the domain that remains bound to DNA (mature-Prm2) was found to be positively selected in primates and under relaxed constraint in rodents. Changes in cleaved-Prm2 coding sequence are significantly correlated to sperm head width and elongation in rodents. Contrary to expectations, a significant effect of sexual selection was not found on either domain or clade. CONCLUSIONS: Mature-PRM2 may be free to evolve under less constraint due to the existence of PRM1 as a more conserved and functionally redundant copy. The cleaved-PRM2 domain seems to play an important role in sperm head shaping. However, sexual selection on its sequence may be difficult to detect until it is identified which sperm head phenotype (shape and size) confers advantages for sperm performance in different mammalian clades.",

Histological examination showed no evidence of re-establishment of spermatogenesis in autografts, and progressive degeneration of seminiferous tubules was detected. Expression of germ cell-specific proteins such as POU5F1, DAZL, TNP1, TNP2, PRM1 and PRM2 revealed that, although proliferating and differentiating spermatogenic germ cells such as spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids could survive in autografts until 4 weeks, only terminally differentiated germ cells such as sperm persisted in autografts until 8 weeks.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG), which produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's submission to NICE. Nivolumab was compared with docetaxel, paclitaxel, best supportive care and retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin plus gemcitabine, but only for patients whose disease has had an adequate response in first-line treatment). Two ongoing, phase I/II, single-arm studies for nivolumab were identified, but no studies directly compared nivolumab with any specified comparator. Evidence from directly examining the single arms of the trial data indicated little difference between the outcomes measured from the nivolumab and comparator studies. A simulated treatment comparison (STC) analysis was used in an attempt to reduce the bias induced by na\u00efve comparison, but there was no clear evidence that risk of bias was reduced. Multiple limitations in the STC were identified and remained. The effect of an analysis based on different combinations of covariates in the prediction model remains unknown. The ERG's concerns regarding the economic analysis included the use of a non-established response-based survival analysis method, which introduced additional uncertainty. The use of time-dependent hazard ratios produced overfitting and was not represented in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The use of a treatment stopping rule to cap treatment cost left treatment effectiveness unaltered. A relevant comparator was excluded from the base-case analysis. The revised ERG deterministic base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on the company's Appraisal Consultation Document response were \u00a358,791, \u00a378,869 and \u00a362,352 per quality-adjusted life-year gained versus paclitaxel, docetaxel and best supportive care, respectively. Nivolumab was dominated by cisplatin plus gemcitabine in the ERG base case. Substantial uncertainties about the relative treatment effectiveness comparing nivolumab against all comparators remained. NICE did not recommend nivolumab, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had platinum-containing therapy, and considered that nivolumab was not suitable for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund.",

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed DMARD and steroid use in IA patients referred to a rheumatologist-led ultrasound clinic.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory disorder and is associated with progressive destruction of synovial joints and physical disability. Therapies with known benefits include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate, as well as more recent biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF therapy). METHOD: This was a\u00a0retrospective study, which included 205 RA and 112 early RA (ERA) patients from the Rheumatology Clinic at Gaziantep University School of Medicine Research Center as well as 104 healthy controls. RESULTS: The mean neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was found to be 3.15\u00a0\u00b1 2.64 in the patient group and 2.03\u00a0\u00b1 0.94 in the control group. The mean platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was 162.39\u00a0\u00b1 107.76 in the patient group and 131.23\u00a0\u00b1 48.09 in the control group. There was a\u00a0significant difference in both the NLR and PLR between the patient and control groups (both p\u00a0< 0.01). There was a\u00a0significant difference in both the NLR and PLR between patients with active disease and remission (both p\u00a0< 0.001) in RA, including anti-TNF therapy and DMARDs groups. There was a\u00a0significant difference in NLR (p\u00a0= 0.001) but not in PLR (p\u00a0= 0.051) between active disease and remission in ERA. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that the NLR may be considered a\u00a0useful marker of disease activity in RA and one that can aid the diagnosis of ERA. The PLR can be used in the assessment of disease activity in RA patients undergoing anti-TNF therapy but is not suitable for diagnosing ERA.",

Mitochondria play a central role for cell metabolism, energy production and control of apoptosis. Inadequate mitochondrial function has been found responsible for very diverse diseases, ranging from neurological pathologies to cancer. Interestingly, mitochondria have recently been shown to display the capacity to be transferred between cell types, notably from human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to cancer cells in coculture conditions, with metabolic and functional consequences for the mitochondria recipient cells, further enhancing the current interest for the biological properties of these organelles. Evaluating the effects of the transferred MSC mitochondria in the target cells is of primary importance to understand the biological outcome of such cell-cell interactions. The MitoCeption protocol described here allows the transfer of the mitochondria isolated beforehand from the donor cells to the target cells, using MSC mitochondria and glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) as a model system. This protocol has previously been used to transfer mitochondria, isolated from MSCs, to adherent MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. This mitochondria transfer protocol is adapted here for GSCs that present the specific particularity of growing as neurospheres in vitro. The transfer of the isolated mitochondria can be followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal imaging using mitochondria vital dyes. The use of mitochondria donor and target cells with distinct haplotypes (SNPs) also allows detection of the transferred mitochondria based on the concentration of their circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the target cells. Once the protocol has been validated with these criteria, the cells harboring the transferred mitochondria can be further analyzed to determine the effects of the exogenous mitochondria on biological properties such as cell metabolism, plasticity, proliferation and response to therapy.",

However, determining the proper role of mitochondria in defined biological contexts was hampered by the lack of suitable experimental tools. We designed a protocol (MitoCeption) to directly and quantitatively transfer mitochondria, isolated from cell type A, to recipient cell type B. We validated and quantified the effective mitochondria transfer by imaging, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and mitochondrial DNA analysis. We show that the transfer of minute amounts of mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) mitochondria to cancer cells, a process otherwise occurring naturally in coculture, results in cancer cell enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity and favors cancer cell proliferation and invasion. The MitoCeption technique, which can be applied to different cell systems, will therefore be a method of choice to analyze the metabolic modifications induced by exogenous mitochondria in host cells.",

Most commonly, deficits of galactosylceramidase result in widespread central and peripheral nervous system demyelination and death in affected infants typically by 2 years of age. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the current standard of care in children diagnosed prior to symptom onset. However, disease correction is incomplete.

Adapted from studies in twitcher mice, GLD dogs were treated by combination intravenous and intracerebroventricular injections of AAVrh10 to target both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Combination of intravenous and intracerebroventricular AAV gene therapy had a clear dose response and resulted in delayed onset of clinical signs, extended life-span, correction of biochemical defects, and attenuation of neuropathology.

BACKGROUND: Krabbe disease is a rare neurodegenerative genetic disorder caused by deficiency of galactocerebrosidase. Patients with the infantile form of Krabbe disease can be treated at a presymptomatic stage with human stem cell transplantation which improves survival and clinical outcomes. However, without a family history, most cases of infantile Krabbe disease present after onset of symptoms and are ineligible for transplantation. In 2006, New York began screening newborns for Krabbe disease to identify presymptomatic cases. To ensure that those identified with infantile disease received timely treatment, New York public health and medical systems took steps to accurately diagnose and rapidly refer infants for human stem cell transplantation within the first few weeks of life. After 11\u00a0years of active screening in New York and the introduction of Krabbe disease newborn screening in other states, new information has been gained which can inform the design of newborn screening programs to improve infantile Krabbe disease outcomes. FINDINGS: Recent information relevant to Krabbe disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment were assessed by a diverse group of public health, medical, and advocacy professionals. Outcomes after newborn screening may improve if treatment for infantile disease is initiated before 30\u00a0days of life. Newer laboratory screening and diagnostic tools can improve the speed and specificity of diagnosis and help facilitate this early referral. Given the rarity of Krabbe disease, most recommendations were based on case series or expert opinion. CONCLUSION: This report updates recommendations for Krabbe disease newborn screening to improve the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment of infantile Krabbe disease. In the United States, several states have begun or are considering Krabbe disease newborn screening. These recommendations can guide public health laboratories on methodologies for screening and inform clinicians about the need to promptly diagnose and treat infantile Krabbe disease. The timing of the initial referral after newborn screening, the speed of diagnostic confirmation of infantile disease, and the transplantation center's experience and ability to rapidly respond to a suspected patient with newly diagnosed infantile Krabbe disease are critical for optimal outcomes.",

We performed homozygosity mapping in both siblings using an Affymetrix 250K Nspl SNP array. One of the overlapping homozygous regions harbored the gene CFL2. Because a mutation in CFL2 was identified in a family with nemaline myopathy, we performed sequence analysis of the gene and a novel homozygous missense mutation in exon 2 (c.19G>A, p.Val7Met) of CFL2 was identified in both siblings. CFL2 encodes the protein cofilin-2, which plays an important role in regulation of sarcomeric actin filaments.

Recently, Wharton's jelly (WJ) was proven as the best MSC source among various compartments of UC. However, it is still unclear whether or not Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs) from different parts of the whole cord exhibit the same characteristics. There may be varied MSCs present in different parts of WJ throughout the length of the UC. For this purpose, using an explant attachment method, WJMSCs were isolated from three different parts of the UC, mainly present towards the placenta (mother part), the center of the whole cord (central part) and the part attached to the fetus (baby part). WJMSCs from all three parts were maintained in normal growth conditions (10% ADMEM) and analyzed for mesenchymal markers, pluripotent genes, proliferation rate and tri-lineage differentiation potential. All WJMSCs were highly proliferative, positively expressed CD90, CD105, CD73 and vimentin, while not expressing CD34, CD45, CD14, CD19 or HLA-DR, differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes and expressed pluripotency markers OCT-4, SOX-2 and NANOG at gene and protein levels. Furthermore, MSCs derived from all the parts were shown to have potency towards hepatocyte-like cell differentiation. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were used as a positive control.

Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a natural organosulfur compound from the garlic, exhibits effective antitumor properties.

In the present study, we reported that DATS efficiently inhibited the viability of breast CSCs as evidenced by reducing turmorspheres formation, decreasing the expression of breast CSCs markers (CD44, ALDH1A1, Nanog, and Oct4), as well as inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed that DATS downregulated the activity of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, while LiCl-triggered Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation diminished DATS inhibition on breast CSCs. Taken together, our results illustrated that DATS suppressed breast CSCs through inhibiting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation.

RATIONALE: Chronic lung allograft dysfunction is the biggest impediment to long-term survival after lung transplantation. Studies have shown an increased risk for chronic lung allograft dysfunction in patients exposed to traffic-related air pollution, using residential distance to roadways and outdoor pollution. OBJECTIVES: Personal monitoring and the indoor environment post-lung transplantation have not been investigated. The exposome is a novel conceptual framework that allows for concurrent examination of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including environmental exposures, as well as changes in exposures over time, to elucidate the complex environmental factors that affect health outcomes. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled newly transplanted double-lung recipients for comprehensive indoor and personal environmental monitoring at 6 and 12 weeks after lung transplantation. In addition, home surveys were completed. To date, 43 patients have been enrolled; 37 patients have been followed for 6 months post-lung transplantation, a time point at which previous studies showed that most patients will have achieved maximal graft function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second). RESULTS: We conducted preliminary analysis using the exposome globe technique with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. It revealed that chromium metal in the air was associated with home age, whereas vanadium was associated with residential proximity to a major road. Metals in the indoor air were also associated with one another and with ultrafine particles. Indoor black carbon was associated with attached garage, and personal monitoring black carbon was highly correlated to black carbon in the home. In a multivariate linear model optimized with Akaike information criterion, distance to major road and indoor particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 \u03bcm were significantly associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second at 6 months. In a subset of patients for whom indoor metal analysis was available, metal content of indoor particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 \u03bcm was associated with lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second. CONCLUSIONS: As people spend most of their time indoors, the home environment plays a role in post-lung transplantation outcomes. Future analysis with more patients and longer follow-up will allow us to identify potential environmental factors that contribute to chronic lung allograft dysfunction and to identify potential interventions.",

Recent Advances: By using examples of stress induced by various mechanisms, we focus on the biomarkers that have been used to assess OS and inflammation in these conditions. We discuss the difference between biomarkers that are the result of a chemical reaction (such as lipid peroxides or oxidized proteins that are a result of the reaction of molecules with reactive oxygen species) and those that represent the biological response to stress, such as the transcription factor NRF2 or inflammation and inflammatory cytokines. CRITICAL ISSUES: The high-throughput and holistic approaches to biomarker discovery used extensively in large-scale molecular epidemiological exposome are also discussed in the context of human exposure to environmental stressors.

Recent evidence has highlighted the key role of epigenetic mechanisms in mediating gene-environment interactions and translating exposures into tumorigenesis. There is also growing evidence that epigenetic changes may be risk factor-specific (\"fingerprints\") that should prove instrumental in the discovery of new biomarkers in cancer. Here, we review the state of the science of epigenetics associated with environmental stimuli and cancer risk, highlighting key developments in the field. Critical knowledge gaps and research needs are discussed and advances in epigenomics that may help in understanding the functional relevance of epigenetic alterations. Key elements required for causality inferences linking epigenetic changes to exposure and cancer are discussed and how these alterations can be incorporated in carcinogen evaluation and in understanding mechanisms underlying epigenome deregulation by the environment.",

Severity and response to treatment may be impacted by various external factors or exposome. AIM: To assess the impact of environmental factors on acne and to provide a comprehensive overview of the acne exposome. METHODS: Two consensus meetings of five European dermatologists and a comprehensive literature search on exposome factors triggering acne served as a basis for this review. RESULTS: Acne exposome was defined as the sum of all environmental factors influencing the occurrence, duration and severity of acne. Exposome factors impact on the response and the frequency of relapse to treatments by interacting with the skin barrier, sebaceous gland, innate immunity and cutaneous microbiota. They may be classified into the following six main categories: nutrition, psychological and lifestyle factors, occupational factors including cosmetics, as well as pollutants, medication and climatic factors. Moreover, practical considerations for the dermatologist's clinical practice are proposed. CONCLUSION: Exposome factors including nutrition, medication, occupational factors, pollutants, climatic factors, and psychosocial and lifestyle factors may impact on the course and severity of acne and on treatment efficacy. Identifying and reducing the impact of exposome is important for an adequate acne disease management.",

BACKGROUND: Strimvelis (autologous CD34+ cells transduced to express adenosine deaminase [ADA]) is the first ex vivo stem cell gene therapy approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), indicated as a single treatment for patients with ADA-severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) who lack a suitable matched related bone marrow donor. Existing primary immunodeficiency registries are tailored to transplantation outcomes and do not capture the breadth of safety and efficacy endpoints required by the EMA for the long-term monitoring of gene therapies. Furthermore, for extended monitoring of Strimvelis, the young age of children treated, small patient numbers, and broad geographic distribution of patients all increase the risk of loss to follow-up before sufficient data have been collected. Establishing individual investigator sites would be impractical and uneconomical owing to the small number of patients from each location receiving Strimvelis. RESULTS: An observational registry has been established to monitor the safety and effectiveness of Strimvelis in up to 50 patients over a minimum of 15\u00a0years. To address the potential challenges highlighted above, data will be collected by a single investigator site at Ospedale San Raffaele (OSR), Milan, Italy, and entered into the registry via a central electronic platform. Patients/families and the patient's local physician will also be able to submit healthcare information directly to the registry using a uniquely designed electronic platform. Data entry will be monitored by a Gene Therapy Registry Centre (funded by GlaxoSmithKline) who will ensure that necessary information is collected and flows between OSR, the patient/family and the patient's local healthcare provider. CONCLUSION: The Strimvelis registry sets a precedent for the safety monitoring of future gene therapies. A unique, patient-focused design has been implemented to address the challenges of long-term follow-up of patients treated with gene therapy for a rare disease. Strategies to ensure data completeness and patient retention in the registry will help fulfil pharmacovigilance requirements. Collaboration with partners is being sought to expand from a treatment registry into a disease registry. Using practical and cost-efficient approaches, the Strimvelis registry is hoped to encourage further innovation in registry design within orphan drug development.",

Despite this biomedical relevance, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the human surfaceome, and only a fraction of the predicted 5,000 human transmembrane proteins have been shown to be located at the plasma membrane. To enable analysis of the human surfaceome, we developed the surfaceome predictor SURFY, based on machine learning. As a training set, we used experimentally verified high-confidence cell-surface proteins from the Cell Surface Protein Atlas (CSPA) and trained a random forest classifier on 131 features per protein and, specifically, per topological domain. SURFY was used to predict a human surfaceome of 2,886 proteins with an accuracy of 93.5%, which shows excellent overlap with known cell-surface protein classes (i.e., receptors). In deposited mRNA data, we found that between 543 and 1,100 surfaceome genes were expressed in cancer cell lines and maximally 1,700 surfaceome genes were expressed in embryonic stem cells and derivative lines. Thus, the surfaceome diversity depends on cell type and appears to be more dynamic than the nonsurface proteome.

Secondarily, it aims at understanding if these interventions may improve stress resilience. PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles in English or Italian about studies involving healthy and sub-healthy subjects or patients with a diagnosed disease about effects of balneotherapy, mud/peloid therapy, and spa therapy on serum and salivary cortisol levels. Fifteen studies involving 684 subjects were included. Five studies investigated biological effects of balneotherapy alone.

Ten studies investigated biological effects of spa therapy with or without included mud/peloid therapy, and in all but two studies, significant variations of cortisol levels were reported.

METHODS: Healthy young men (18-35 years) completed either the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) (n = 33) or a Placebo-TSST (n = 34).

We used mixed-design ANOVAs to test group differences, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to assess the discriminatory power of each measure, and Spearman correlation analyses to probe the association between measures. RESULTS: The largest area under the ROC curve was observed in salivary cortisone at 20 min after the end of the TSST (AUC = 0.909 \u00b1 0.044, p < 0.0001).

Currently, the dynamics regulating the cGAS pathway are poorly understood; limiting our knowledge of how DNA-induced immune responses are regulated.

A local sensitivity analysis demonstrated that parameter sensitivity trends across model ensembles were independent of the select parameterization. An in-silico knock-down of TREX1 found that the interferon response is highly robust, showing that complete inhibition is necessary to induce chemical conditions consistent with chronic inflammation. Lastly, we demonstrate that the model recapitulates interferon expression data resulting from small molecule inhibition of cGAS.

Our structural work supports the understanding of how ds-DNA activates cGAS, suggesting a site for small molecule binders that may cause cGAS activation at physiological ATP concentrations, and an apparent hotspot for inhibitor binding. Mechanistic studies of cGAS provide the first kinetic constants for 2',3'-cGAMP formation, and interestingly, describe a catalytic mechanism where 2',3'-cGAMP may be a minor product of cGAS compared with linear nucleotides.",

We have previously shown functional expression by osteoblasts of signaling machineries required for neurotransmission in the brain. In this study, we have evaluated possible functional expression of different osseous genes in the brain. In embryonic and adult mouse brains, mRNA expression was invariably seen for the master regulator of osteoblastic differentiation Runt related factor-2 (Runx2), in addition to the partner protein core binding factor-beta and their targets such as osteopontin (OPN) and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13), but not for collagen-I or osteocalcin. In pluripotent P19 progenitor cells, Runx2 mRNA expression was drastically increased along with mRNA expression of an astrocytic marker, but not with neuronal marker mRNA expression. Both mRNA and corresponding protein were detected for Runx2 in cultured rat neocortical astrocytes and astrocytic C6 glioma cells. In C6 glioma cells, transient overexpression of Runx2 significantly increased mRNA expression of MMP13, but not of OPN. Moreover, transient overexpression of Runx2 significantly increased luciferase activity in C6 glioma cells transfected with the reporter plasmid linked to a wild-type Runx2 binding element in the MMP13 promoter, but not in cells with a mutated element. These results suggest that Runx2 signal input may lead to transactivation of MMP13 gene without affecting OPN expression in astrocytes.",

BACKGROUND: Dislocated metatarsophalangeal joints from clawed or hammer toes can be a disabling consequence of several conditions. The Cobb-Stainsby forefoot arthroplasty combines partial phalangectomy (Stainsby) with extensor tendon transfer to the metatarsal head (Cobb). We present a retrospective, three surgeon case series of 215 toes in 126 patients. METHODS: Early results and complications were gathered from the medical charts of 126 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-five patients were contactable by phone with a follow up range of 12-82 months (median follow up 45 months). Primary outcome measures were improvement of pain and function, reduction in plantar callosities and cosmetic improvement of the deformity. RESULTS: Pre-operatively all patients presented with pain and shoe wear problems. Post-operatively seventy-two patients (96%) were satisfied, 72 (96%) reported pain relief, 55 (73%) were happy with toe control, 61 (81%) were pleased with cosmesis and 56 (75%) reported unlimited daily activities. Superficial wound infections were observed in 13 of the 126 patients (10%) and two in 75 patients (2%) developed recurrent clawing.

Many epithelial tissues undergo extensive remodelling during morphogenesis. How their epithelial features, such as apicobasal polarity or adhesion, are maintained and remodelled and how adhesion and polarity proteins contribute to morphogenesis are two important questions in development. Here, we approach these issues by investigating the role of the apical determinant protein Crumbs (Crb) during the morphogenesis of the embryonic Drosophila tracheal system. Crb accumulates differentially throughout tracheal development and is required for different tracheal events. The earliest requirement for Crb is for tracheal invagination, which is preceded by an enhanced accumulation of Crb in the invagination domain. There, Crb, acting in parallel with the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) pathway, is required for tracheal cell apical constriction and for organising an actomyosin complex, which we propose is mediated by Crb recruitment of moesin (Moe). The ability of a Crb isoform unable to rescue polarity in crb mutants to otherwise rescue their invagination phenotype, and the converse inability of a FERM-binding domain mutant Crb to rescue faulty invagination, support our hypothesis that it is the absence of Crb-dependent Moe enrichment, and not the polarity defect, that mainly underlies the crb invagination phenotype. This hypothesis is supported by the phenotype of lethal giant larvae (lgl); crb double mutants. These results unveil a link between Crb and the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton during morphogenesis.",

Most tubes have seams (intercellular or autocellular junctions that seal membranes together into a tube), but \"seamless\" tubes also exist. In Drosophila, stellate-shaped tracheal terminal cells make seamless tubes, with single branches running through each of dozens of cellular extensions. We find that mutations in braided impair terminal cell branching and cause formation of seamless tube cysts. We show that braided encodes Syntaxin7 and that cysts also form in cells deficient for other genes required either for membrane scission (shibire) or for early endosome formation (Rab5, Vps45, and Rabenosyn-5). These data define a requirement for early endocytosis in shaping seamless tube lumens. Importantly, apical proteins Crumbs and phospho-Moesin accumulate to aberrantly high levels in braided terminal cells. Overexpression of either Crumbs or phosphomimetic Moesin induced lumenal cysts and decreased terminal branching. Conversely, the braided seamless tube cyst phenotype was suppressed by mutations in crumbs or Moesin. Indeed, mutations in Moesin dominantly suppressed seamless tube cyst formation and restored terminal branching. We propose that early endocytosis maintains normal steady-state levels of Crumbs, which recruits apical phosphorylated (active) Moe, which in turn regulates seamless tube shape through modulation of cortical actin filaments.",

Circulating levels rise in the preprandial phase, suggesting an anticipatory or cephalic phase of release, and decline in the postprandial phase, suggesting either the loss of a stimulatory factor or inhibition by factors released when nutrients enter the intestine. We hypothesized that vagal signals are not required for the (i) preprandial increase or (ii) postprandial suppression of ghrelin levels. Further, we wanted to investigate the hypothesis that (iii) glucagon-like peptide-1 might be implicated in the postprandial decline in ghrelin levels. METHODS: We measured ghrelin levels in plasma from sham-feeding and meal studies carried out in vagotomized individuals and controls, and from a GLP-1 infusion study carried out in fasting healthy young individuals. KEY RESULTS: We find that (i) ghrelin secretion is unchanged during indirect vagal stimulation as elicited by modified sham-feeding in vagotomized individuals and matched controls, (ii) ghrelin secretion is similarly suppressed after meal ingestion in vagotomized individuals and controls, and (iii) infusion of GLP-1 does not lower ghrelin levels.

We examined the fungal synapse (FS) formation in wild-type and AIRE-knockdown THP-1 cells differentiated to macrophages, as well as monocyte-derived macrophages from APECED patients. We evaluated Dectin-2 receptor signaling, phagocytosis, and cytokine secretion upon hyphal stimulation. AIRE co-localized with Dectin-2 and Syk at the FS upon hyphal stimulation of macrophage-like THP-1 cells. AIRE-knockdown macrophage-like THP-1 cells exhibited less Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 receptors accumulation, decreased signaling pathway activity at the FS, lower C. albicans phagocytosis, and less lysosome formation.
