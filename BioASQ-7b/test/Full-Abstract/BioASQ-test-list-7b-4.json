Summary: Split-networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that have proven to be a powerful tool in phylogenetics. Various ways have been developed for computing such networks, including split-decomposition, NeighborNet, QNet and FlatNJ. Some of these approaches are implemented in the user-friendly SplitsTree software package. However, to give the user the option to adjust and extend these approaches and to facilitate their integration into analysis pipelines, there is a need for robust, open-source implementations of associated data structures and algorithms. Here, we present SPECTRE, a readily available, open-source library of data structures written in Java, that comes complete with new implementations of several pre-published algorithms and a basic interactive graphical interface for visualizing planar split networks. SPECTRE also supports the use of longer running algorithms by providing command line interfaces, which can be executed on servers or in High Performance Computing environments. Availability and implementation: Full source code is available under the GPLv3 license at: https://github.com/maplesond/SPECTRE. SPECTRE's core library is available from Maven Central at: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/uk.ac.uea.cmp.spectre/core.

We present QNet, a method for constructing split networks from weighted quartet trees. QNet can be viewed as a quartet analogue of the distance-based Neighbor-Net (NNet) method for network construction. Just as NNet, QNet works by agglomeratively computing a collection of circular weighted splits of the taxa set which is subsequently represented by a planar split network. To illustrate the applicability of QNet, we apply it to a previously published Salmonella data set. We conclude that QNet can provide a useful alternative to NNet if distance data are not available or a character-based approach is preferred. Moreover, it can be used as an aid for determining when a quartet-based tree-building method may or may not be appropriate for a given data set. QNet is freely available for download.",

Split networks are a type of phylogenetic network that allow visualization of conflict in evolutionary data. We present a new method for constructing such networks called FlatNetJoining (FlatNJ). A key feature of FlatNJ is that it produces networks that can be drawn in the plane in which labels may appear inside of the network. For complex data sets that involve, for example, non-neutral molecular markers, this can allow additional detail to be visualized as compared to previous methods such as split decomposition and NeighborNet. We illustrate the application of FlatNJ by applying it to whole HIV genome sequences, where recombination has taken place, fluorescent proteins in corals, where ancestral sequences are present, and mitochondrial DNA sequences from gall wasps, where biogeographical relationships are of interest. We find that the networks generated by FlatNJ can facilitate the study of genetic variation in the underlying molecular sequence data and, in particular, may help to investigate processes such as intra-locus recombination.

The purpose of our communication is to report on an additional patient with DOOR syndrome, delineate common as well as less frequent manifestations of DOOR syndrome, bring attention to the under appreciated facial features in DOOR syndrome, document the natural history of this disorder, and propose a suggested workup of those suspected of DOOR syndrome. DOOR syndrome is associated with characteristic, coarse facial features with large nose with wide nasal bridge, bulbous tip and anteverted nares, a long prominent philtrum and downturned corners of the mouth. The natural history is one of a deteriorative course, with progressive neurological manifestations including sensorineural deafness, seizures from infancy, optic atrophy, and a peripheral polyneuropathy. The majority of patients with DOOR syndrome have elevated levels of 2-oxoglutarate in the urine and plasma. In this report, we present a newborn with manifestations consistent with DOOR syndrome and a progressive clinical course. A comprehensive literature review reveals 32 patients with DOOR syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Venomous animals incapacitate their prey using complex venoms that can contain hundreds of unique protein toxins. The realisation that many of these toxins may have pharmaceutical and insecticidal potential due to their remarkable potency and selectivity against target receptors has led to an explosion in the number of new toxins being discovered and characterised. From an evolutionary perspective, spiders are the most successful venomous animals and they maintain by far the largest pool of toxic peptides. However, at present, there are no databases dedicated to spider toxins and hence it is difficult to realise their full potential as drugs, insecticides, and pharmacological probes. DESCRIPTION: We have developed ArachnoServer, a manually curated database that provides detailed information about proteinaceous toxins from spiders. Key features of ArachnoServer include a new molecular target ontology designed especially for venom toxins, the most up-to-date taxonomic information available, and a powerful advanced search interface. Toxin information can be browsed through dynamic trees, and each toxin has a dedicated page summarising all available information about its sequence, structure, and biological activity. ArachnoServer currently manages 567 protein sequences, 334 nucleic acid sequences, and 51 protein structures. CONCLUSION: ArachnoServer provides a single source of high-quality information about proteinaceous spider toxins that will be an invaluable resource for pharmacologists, neuroscientists, toxinologists, medicinal chemists, ion channel scientists, clinicians, and structural biologists.

Triple A syndrome (TAS) or Allgrove syndrome (OMIM #231550) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by adrenocorticotropic hormone-resistant adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, achalasia, and neurological and dermatological abnormalities. Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006 and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was impossible to establish. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of TAS.

Background Triple A syndrome is characterized by achalasia, alacrima and adrenal insufficiency with neurological manifestations occurring later in the course of the disease. It occurs due to biallelic mutations in the AAAS gene which codes for the nuclear pore protein ALADIN. A number of other features have been reported over time in this heterogeneous and multisystemic disorder. Unlike other autosomal recessive disorders, triple A syndrome patients show a wide phenotypic variability both among different patients and family members harboring the same mutation(s). A gene-environment interaction has been thought to be a plausible cause. Methods A retrospective analysis of six families and seven patients presenting with triple A syndrome was carried out. The clinical, biochemical and molecular testing data were collected and correlated. The results of treatment and follow-up and genetic counseling of the families were obtained wherever feasible. Results Our cohort consisted mostly of children and displayed a wide phenotypic variability in the presenting symptoms ranging from hypoglycemic seizures at the severe end of the spectrum to insidious hyperpigmentation and delayed development. Neurological and autonomic features were present in a few patients, suggesting requirement of prolonged follow-up for these patients. A significant gap between the onset of symptoms and confirmatory diagnosis was noted, suggesting that a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosing this disorder.

However, peptides that clear atherogenic lipoproteins, analogous to apoE, via enhanced hepatic uptake have not been previously reviewed. Toward this end, we describe the design and studies of a dual-domain apoE mimetic peptide, Ac-hE18A-NH(2). This peptide consists of residues 141-150, the putative receptor-binding region of human apoE, covalently linked to a well characterized class A amphipathic helix, 18A, which has no sequence homology to any other exchangeable apolipoprotein sequences. It demonstrates dramatic effects in reducing plasma cholesterol levels in dyslipidemic mouse and rabbit models. We discuss the scientific rationale and review the literature for the design and efficacy of the peptide. Analogous to apoE, this peptide bypasses the low-density lipoprotein receptor for the hepatic uptake of atherogenic lipoproteins via heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). ApoE mimetics such as Ac-hE18A-NH(2) may therefore restore or replace ligands in genetically induced hyperlipidemias to enable reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins via HSPG even in the absence of functional low-density lipoprotein receptors. Therefore, this and similar peptides may be useful in the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders such as familial hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.",

Apolipoprotein E (apoE), well known to play a role in lipid transport and cholesterol metabolism, also exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system. Recent clinical and genetic studies display an association between apoE genotype (APOE) and the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis, raising the possibility that modulation of apoE may be a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis. Using a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of human multiple sclerosis, we found that a peptidomimetic of apoE protein, COG133, substantially reduces the clinical symptoms of EAE and promotes remission from the disability when administered before or after onset of disease. Most notably, fusion of COG133 to a protein transduction domain creates COG112, a modified apoE-mimetic peptide with significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory bioactivities in vitro, and improved therapeutic effects on EAE in vivo, which renders a nearly full remission from the disability. Histopathological analysis showed that COG112 and COG133 attenuated demyelination and significantly diminished the number of peripheral cells infiltrating into the spinal cord. ApoE mimetics also interfered with several mechanisms relevant to the pathogenesis of EAE and multiple sclerosis, including activation of macrophages, subsequent production of nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines, and lymphocyte proliferation. These data suggest that apoE mimetics represent a multidimensional therapeutic for multiple sclerosis capable of inhibiting the inflammatory cascade, modulating immune cell function, and reducing clinical signs, which may have novel utility for the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune diseases.",

Histone deacetylases regulate the acetylation levels of numerous proteins and play key roles in physiological processes and disease states. In addition to acetyl groups, deacetylases can remove other acyl modifications on lysines, the roles and regulation of which are far less understood. A peptide-based fluorescent probe for single-reagent, real-time detection of deacetylase activity that can be readily adapted for probing broader lysine deacylation, including decrotonylation, is reported. Following cleavage of the lysine modification, the probe undergoes rapid intramolecular imine formation that results in marked optical changes, thus enabling convenient detection of deacylase activity with good statistical Z' factors for both absorption and fluorescence modalities. The peptide-based design offers broader isozyme scope than that of small-molecule analogues, and is suitable for probing both metal- and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD )-dependent deacetylases. With an effective sirtuin activity assay in hand, it is demonstrated that iron chelation by Sirtinol, a commonly employed sirtuin inhibitor, results in an enhancement in the inhibitory activity of the compound that may affect its performance in vivo.",

BACKGROUND: Heart failure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities of the failing myocardium coupled with an energy-depleted state and cardiac remodeling. The mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function through regulating the mitochondrial acetylome. It is interesting to note that unique cardiac and systemic microRNAs have been shown to play an important role in cardiac remodeling by modulating key signaling elements in the myocardium. METHODS: Cellular signaling was analyzed in human cardiomyocyte-like AC16 cells, and acetylation levels in rodent models of SIRT3and transgenic microRNA-195 (miR-195) overexpression were compared with wild type. Luciferase assays, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation assays, and echocardiographic analysis were performed. Enzymatic activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP synthase were measured. RESULTS: In failing human myocardium, we observed induction of miR-195 along with decreased expression of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 that was associated with increased global protein acetylation. We further investigated the role of miR-195 in SIRT3-mediated metabolic processes and its impact on regulating enzymes involved in deacetylation. Proteomic analysis of the total acetylome showed increased overall acetylation, and specific lysine acetylation of 2 central mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, PDH and ATP synthase, as well. miR-195 downregulates SIRT3 expression through direct 3'-untranslated region targeting. Treatments with either sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, small interfering RNA-mediated SIRT3 knockdown or miR-195 overexpression enhanced acetylation of PDH complex and ATP synthase. This effect diminished PDH and ATP synthase activity and impaired mitochondrial respiration.SIRT3 and miR-195 transgenic mice consistently showed enhanced global protein acetylation, including PDH complex and ATP synthase, associated with decreased enzymatic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data suggest that increased levels of miR-195 in failing myocardium regulate a novel pathway that involves direct SIRT3 suppression and enzymatic inhibition via increased acetylation of PDH and ATP synthase that are essential for cardiac energy metabolism.",

The evolutionarily-conserved sirtuin family of histone deacetylases regulates a multitude of DNA-associated processes. A recent genome-wide screen conducted in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified Yku70/80, which regulate nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and telomere structure, as being essential for cell proliferation in the presence of the pan-sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM). Here, we show that sirtuin-dependent deacetylation of both histone H3 lysine 56 and H4 lysine 16 promotes growth of yku70\u0394 and yku80\u0394 cells, and that the NAM sensitivity of these mutants is not caused by defects in DNA double-strand break repair by NHEJ, but rather by their inability to maintain normal telomere length. Indeed, our results indicate that in the absence of sirtuin activity, cells with abnormally short telomeres, e.g., yku70/80\u0394 or est1/2\u0394 mutants, present striking defects in S phase progression. Our data further suggest that early firing of replication origins at short telomeres compromises the cellular response to NAM- and genotoxin-induced replicative stress. Finally, we show that reducing H4K16ac in yku70\u0394 cells limits activation of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Rad53 in response to replicative stress, which promotes usage of translesion synthesis and S phase progression. Our results reveal a novel interplay between sirtuin-mediated regulation of chromatin structure and telomere-regulating factors in promoting timely completion of S phase upon replicative stress.",

This study developed a novel sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) inhibitor (LC-0296) and examined its role in altering HNSCC tumorigenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of the SIRT3 inhibitor, LC-0296, on cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species levels in HNSCC cells were studied. RESULTS: LC-0296 reduces cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis of HNSCC cells but not of normal human oral keratinocytes. This inhibitory effect is mediated, in part, via modulation of reactive oxygen species levels. Additionally, LC-0296 works synergistically to increase the sensitivity of HNSCC cells to radiation and cisplatin treatment.

Lysine acetylation is a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) that occurs on thousands of lysine residues in diverse organisms from bacteria to humans. Accurate measurement of acetylation stoichiometry on a proteome-wide scale remains challenging. Most methods employ a comparison of chemically acetylated peptides to native acetylated peptides, however, the potentially large differences in abundance between these peptides presents a challenge for accurate quantification. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the most widely used quantitative proteomic methods. Here we show that serial dilution of SILAC-labeled peptides (SD-SILAC) can be used to identify accurately quantified peptides and to estimate the quantification error rate. We applied SD-SILAC to determine absolute acetylation stoichiometry in exponentially-growing and stationary-phase wild-type and Sirtuin deacetylase CobB-deficient cells. To further analyze CobB-regulated sites under conditions of globally increased or decreased acetylation, we measured stoichiometry in phophotransacetylase (pta\u0394) and acetate kinase (ackA\u0394) mutant strains in the presence and absence of the Sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide. We measured acetylation stoichiometry at 3,669 unique sites and found that the vast majority of acetylation occurred at a low stoichiometry. Manipulations that cause increased nonenzymatic acetylation by acetyl-phosphate (AcP), such as stationary-phase arrest and deletion of ackA, resulted in globally increased acetylation stoichiometry. Comparison to relative quantification under the same conditions validated our stoichiometry estimates at hundreds of sites, demonstrating the accuracy of our method. Similar to Sirtuin deacetylase 3 (SIRT3) in mitochondria, CobB suppressed acetylation to lower than median stoichiometry in WT, pta\u0394, and ackA\u0394 cells. Together, our results provide a detailed view of acetylation stoichiometry in E. coli and suggest an evolutionarily conserved function of Sirtuin deacetylases in suppressing low stoichiometry acetylation.",

BACKGROUND: Adolescent substance use is an important public health problem in New Mexico and the United States. The New Mexico Department of Health school-based health centers (SBHCs) universally administer a validated screen, the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble), for adolescent substance use concerns; however, quality assurance efforts revealed that SBHC providers needed more information at the point of screening to initiate brief interventions for students with positive CRAFFT screens. The CHISPA (Cocaine, Heroin, IV drugs, Synthetic pot, Pot, Alcohol) was developed to gather specific information on recent substance use experience to guide brief interventions. This paper describes the development and initial reliability and validity of data obtained using the CHISPA instrument. METHODS: In 2015, 99 high school-aged SBHC users in Albuquerque, New Mexico, completed the CRAFFT and CHISPA twice over 2\u00a0weeks using standard test-retest methods. Using the CHISPA, students reported for the prior 3\u00a0months substances used, frequency of use, and signs of addiction or acute danger (adverse events). RESULTS: Retest reliability for the CRAFFT score was 0.82. CHISPA retest reliabilities were 0.75 for alcohol use; 0.91 for having used any substances; 0.92 for number of substances used; 0.81 for frequency of substance use; and 0.79 for number of adverse events. CRAFFT scores correlated with CHISPA measures of number of substances used at 0.62; with frequency of substance use at 0.58; and with number of adverse events at 0.64. CONCLUSIONS: CHISPA measures show preliminary evidence of reliability and validity. SBHC providers and other providers in primary care settings who use the CRAFFT screen may benefit from using the CHISPA to define recent substance use experience to guide brief interventions for adolescents with substance use concerns. The CHISPA instrument is currently being tested in electronic form in selected SBHCs in the state of New Mexico.",

The CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble, 1999) was developed as a brief screening instrument for adolescents to measure AUD and SUD. This systematic review examines the psychometric properties of the CRAFFT. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews, Pubmed/Medline, Embase (1980 to present), PsycInfo, and Google Scholar using the keywords \"CRAFFT\", \"CRAFFT questionnaire\", \"alcohol misuse\", \"alcohol abuse\", \"alcohol dependence\" \"alcohol\", \"substance misuse\", and \"substance abuse\" and \"substance dependence\". RESULTS: We report 11 studies on validity and six studies on reliability. Populations examined were clinic patients including hospital-based clinic patients, primary care patients, emergency room patients, Native-Americans, sexually transmitted diseases clinic patients, substance users, a general population group, and enlisting military concripts. In general, the CRAFFT was found to be a good screening instrument for gradations of alcohol and substance misuse including problem use, abuse, and dependence. At optimal cut-points, sensitivities of the CRAFFT ranged from 0.61 to 1.00, and specificities ranged from 0.33 to 0.97. The CRAFFT showed modest to adequate internal consistency values ranging from 0.65 to 0.86, and high test-retest reliability. CONCLUSION: The CRAFFT has adequate psychometric properties for detecting AUD and SUD in adolescents.

BACKGROUND: Quantitation of lymphocyte subsets (B cells, T cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells and NK cells) classically relies on quantitation of lymphocytes and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. AQUIOS CL (Beckman Coulter) is a fully automated system that performs an onboard volumetric cell count, automatically processes the sample (staining, lysing and fixation) and analyzes the results. We compared AQUIOS CL to a dual-platform analysis and evaluated analytical performance. METHODS: We evaluated precision, sample stability, inter-sample carryover, linearity and interpanel consistency. AQUIOS CL was compared to a dual-platform method (Sysmex XE-5000 and BD FACSCanto-II). A total of 113 patient samples were included: 45 from posttransplant patients, 44 from children and 24 random routine samples. The degree of automation was scored through the need of manual revisions triggered by AQUIOS CL run notifications and run flags. RESULTS: Intrarun and interrun variability was <9.1% with dedicated control material and <32.1% with patient samples. Relative values of lymphocyte subsets could be determined up to 48 h after venipuncture when the sample was kept at room temperature. There was no carryover and good linearity. Interpanel consistency was 3.3% for relative values and 9.4% for absolute values. Method comparison showed good analytical correlation between AQUIOS CL and a dual-platform method. Thirty-five percent of the samples triggered a run notification.

Aims: Thermal ablation can evoke an immune response, which may have effects on the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our aim is to investigate the changes of circulating T-cell subsets after microwave ablation (MWA) and to explore the risk factors of tumor recurrence in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. Methods: Thirty patients with HBV-related HCC were enrolled in this study. The blood samples were collected both before and after MWA (24 h, 72 h, and 1 month after MWA). The distributions of Th17 cells, regulatory Treg-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, and CD3+ T-cells were determined by flow cytometer. The potential-related factors of tumor recurrence were analyzed by logistic regression. Results: The levels of circulating T-cell subsets, except for Th17 cells, were relatively stable after MWA. The frequency of Th17 cells increased from 3.98% \u00b1 2.40% before treatment to 5.53% \u00b13.27% 24 h after treatment. Eight of 30 patients had a tumor recurrence. The results of logistic regression suggested that among 11 candidates, only the level of Th17 cells was the risk factor of tumor recurrence. To remove the interference from other factors, seven patients with tumor(s) >3 cm or alpha-fetoprotein >400 ng/mL were excluded in another parallel logistic regression. The results of such regression clearly demonstrated that circulating Th17 cells is indeed a related factor of tumor recurrence. Conclusions: Thermal ablation may evoke a transitional immune response by increasing the frequency of Th17 cells. Patients with high levels of baseline circulating Th17 cells, instead of the transient elevation of Th17 cells induced by MWA, are at the risk of tumor recurrence.",

OBJECTIVES: To review the latest antiemetic guideline recommendations and provide an update on the use of NEPA, a fixed combination antiemetic composed of the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (RA) netupitant and the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 RA palonosetron (Akynzeo\u00ae). METHODS: Analysis of the literature was performed, including guidelines, published literature, congress data on NEPA, and relevant articles on CINV. FINDINGS: Nurses are in a unique position to promote guideline-consistent antiemetic prophylaxis and are central in the education of patients and caregivers. Thus, nurses\u2019 continuous education on antiemetic treatments is key for the prevention and management of CINV.

Netupitant is a highly selective neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist and palonosetron is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a distinct pharmacological profile. Complete response rates during the delayed, acute and overall phases were significantly higher with single-dose netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron 0.5 mg than with single-dose palonosetron 0.5 mg in cycle 1 of cisplatin-based highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) in a phase II trial and with single-dose netupitant/palonosetron 300/0.5 mg than with single-dose palonosetron 0.5 mg in cycle 1 of anthracycline-cyclophosphamide (AC) moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) in a phase III trial; the greater efficacy of netupitant/palonosetron was maintained over repeated cycles of AC MEC in the phase III trial. In another phase III trial, netupitant/palonosetron 300/0.5 mg was effective over repeated cycles of non-AC MEC or HEC. Netupitant/palonosetron was well tolerated, with no cardiac safety concerns. The convenience of administering netupitant/palonosetron as a single dose in a fixed combination has the potential to improve adherence to CINV prevention guidelines. In conclusion, netupitant/palonosetron is an important option to consider in the prevention of acute and delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC.",

Cisplatin-like chemotherapeutics cause vomiting via calcium (Ca)-dependent release of multiple neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, substance P, etc.) from the gastrointestinal enterochromaffin cells and/or the brainstem. Intracellular Ca signaling is triggered by activation of diverse emetic receptors (including tachykininergic NK, serotonergic 5-HT, dopaminergic D, cholinergic M, or histaminergic H) whose activation in vomit-competent species can evoke emesis. Other emetogens such as cisplatin, rotavirus NSP4 protein and bacterial toxins can also induce intracellular Ca elevation. Netupitant is a highly selective neurokinin NK receptor (NKR) antagonist and palonosetron is a selective second-generation serotonin 5-HT receptor (5-HTR) antagonist with a distinct pharmacological profile. An oral fixed combination of netupitant/palonosetron (NEPA; Akynzeo(\u00ae)) with >85% antiemetic efficacy is available for use in the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Cannabinoid CB receptor agonists possess broad-spectrum antiemetic activity since they prevent vomiting caused by a variety of emetic stimuli including the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, 5-HTR agonists, and DR agonists. Our findings demonstrate that application of the L-type Ca channel (LTCC) agonist FPL 64176 and the intracellular Ca mobilizing agent thapsigargin (a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase inhibitor) cause vomiting in the least shrew. On the other hand, blockade of LTCCs by corresponding antagonists (nifedipine or amlodipine) not only provide broad-spectrum antiemetic efficacy against diverse agents that specifically activate emetogenic receptors such as 5-HT, NK, D, and M receptors, but can also potentiate the antiemetic efficacy of palonosetron against the non-specific emetogen, cisplatin. In this review, we will provide an overview of Ca involvement in the emetic process; discuss the relationship between Ca signaling and the prevailing therapeutics in control of vomiting; highlight the evidence for Ca-signaling blockers/inhibitors in suppressing emetic behavior in the least shrew model of emesis as well as in the clinical setting; and also draw attention to the clinical benefits of Ca-signaling blockers/inhibitors in the treatment of nausea and vomiting.",

Some of these substances are the neurotransmitters (NTs) acetylcholine (ACh), the modified amino acids glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the biogenic amines dopamine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine. In neuropsychiatry, progressive integration of dietary approaches in clinical routine made it necessary to discern the more about some of these dietary NTs. Relevant books and literature from PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for data on food sources of Ach, glutamate, GABA, dopamine, 5-HT, and histamine. Different animal foods, fruits, edible plants, roots, and botanicals were reported to contain NTs. These substances can either be naturally present, as part of essential metabolic processes and ecological interactions, or derive from controlled/uncontrolled food technology processes. Ripening time, methods of preservation and cooking, and microbial activity further contributes to NTs. Moreover, gut microbiota are considerable sources of NTs. However, the significance of dietary NTs intake needs to be further investigated as there are no significant data on their bioavailability, neuronal/non neuronal effects, or clinical implications.

Saccharides such as inulin and other fructo-oligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides, and polydextrose have been widely used to improve gastrointestinal outcomes, but they appear to also influence distant sites. This review examined the effects of prebiotics on bone strength, neural and cognitive processes, immune functioning, skin, and serum lipid profile. The mode of action is in part affected by intestinal permeability and by fermentation products reaching target cells.

The antitoxin antibodies actoxumab and bezlotoxumab bind to and neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. Bezlotoxumab was recently approved by the FDA for reducing the recurrence of CDI. We have previously shown that a single molecule of bezlotoxumab binds to two distinct epitopes within the TcdB combined repetitive oligopeptide (CROP) domain, preventing toxin binding to host cells. In this study, we characterize the binding of actoxumab to TcdA and examine its mechanism of toxin neutralization. Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques, we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189 and 2410-2437. Actoxumab binding caused the aggregation of TcdA especially at higher antibody:toxin concentration ratios. Actoxumab prevented the association of TcdA with target cells demonstrating that actoxumab neutralizes toxin activity by inhibiting the first step of the intoxication cascade. This mechanism of neutralization is similar to that observed with bezlotoxumab and TcdB. Comparisons of the putative TcdA epitope sequences across several C. difficile ribotypes and homologous repeat sequences within TcdA suggest a structural basis for observed differences in actoxumab binding and/or neutralization potency. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the protective effects of the antibody in vitro and in vivo, including in various preclinical models of CDI.",

Diff) induced disease, including when such tests should be done in children and how they should be interpreted. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple tests are available for detecting disease due to C. diff. These include colonoscopy and stool analysis. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the most sensitive test for detecting the presence of colitis. The toxins produced by the C. diff. (toxin A, toxin B, and binary toxin) are the agents that cause injury and disease. Only toxin producing C. diff. Strains will cause disease. Binary toxin by itself is not thought to produce disease. Binary toxin causes disease in humans when present with toxin A and B producing bacteria, and has been implicated with fulminant life threatening disease. Stool analyses vary in sensitivity and specificity depending on the assay used. The presence of toxin producing strains of C diff. in the stool does not equate with disease. The presence of a toxin-producing bacteria or toxins (A or B) only equates with disease if diarrhea or a diseased colon (toxic megacolon, ileus, and sepsis) is present. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), when used in the stool from patients with diarrhea, appears to be the most efficient study to detect the gene that encodes for toxin A and B and thus to diagnose C. diff.-induced disease. Infants have a high carriage rate of C. diff. and are believed not to develop disease from it or its toxins. Infants should not be tested for C. difficile. The NAAT is most specific when done on patients with diarrhea with liquid stools. Testing for C. difficile should only be done on patients with diarrhea. One can assume that a patient who has no diarrhea and is not ill does not have C. diff.-induced disease. Treatment should be limited to patients with diarrhea who test positive for C. diff. toxin (A or B) or toxin-producing bacteria. Direct testing for binary toxin is not commercially available. Binary toxin is only thought to cause disease in humans when C. diff. toxin (A and B)-producing bacteria are present.",

Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive intestine bacterium that causes a severe diarrhea and could eventually be lethal. The main virulence factor is related to the release of two major exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB). Recent C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) outbreaks have been caused by hypervirulent strains which secrete an additional binary toxin (CDTa/CDTb). Vaccination against these toxins is considered the best way to combat the CDAD. Recently, a novel tetravalent C. difficile vaccine candidate containing all four toxins produced from a baculovirus expression system has been developed. A dose assay to release this tetravalent C. difficile vaccine was developed using tandem ion-exchange HPLC chromatography. A sequential weak cation exchange (carboxyl group) and weak anion exchange (tertiary amine group) columns were employed. The four C. difficile vaccine antigen pIs range from 4.4 to 8.6. The final optimized separation employs salt gradient elution at two different pHs. The standard analytical parameters such as LOD, LOQ, linearity, accuracy, precision and repeatability were evaluated for this method and it was deemed acceptable as a quantitative assay for vaccine release. Furthermore, the developed method was utilized for monitoring the stability of the tetravalent C. difficile vaccine in final container.",

BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ that secretes a number of adipokines, like Resistin (RETN); it's an adipocytes-secreted cytokine and has been proposed as a link between obesity and diabetes. Many resistin gene polymorphisms were described and their implication in obesity was controversial. This study was to investigate the prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RETN gene 420C/G; 44G/A; 62G/A; 394C/G and 299 G/A and their association with Resistin level and obesity in Tunisian volunteers. METHODS: We recruited 169 nonobese (mean age=42.16-14.26\u00a0years; mean body mass index [BMI]=24.51-3.69\u00a0kg/m ) and 160 obese (mean age=47.86-11.17\u00a0years; mean BMI=36-4.78\u00a0kg/m ). Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Anthropometric parameters, lipid levels, Glycemia and insulinemia were measured, BMI was calculated and insulinresistance was evaluated with the homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and resistin level was measured by ELISA. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS19.0. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding parameters; the Odds Ratio (OR) of obesity associated with mutated genotypes at 420C/G compared with normal genotype was as: OR=2.17; 95% CI [1.28-3.68], P=.004. The serum Resistin levels present no significant association with all RETN polymorphisms and it was significantly associated with BMI (P=.047). In our haplotype analysis, one haplotype seems to be protective and one other seems to be the highest risk to obesity.

We have established a neonatal rat model of human prematurity involving maternal-neonatal separation and hypoxia with spontaneous hypothermia prevented by external heat. Adults previously exposed to these neonatal stressors show a sex difference in the insulin and glucose response to arginine stimulation suggesting a state of insulin resistance. The current study used this cohort of adult rats to evaluate insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], plasma adipokines (reflecting insulin resistance states), and testosterone. The major findings were that daily maternal-neonatal separation led to an increase in body weight and HOMA-IR in adult male and female rats and increased plasma leptin in adult male rats only; neither prior neonatal hypoxia (without or with body temperature control) nor neonatal hypothermia altered subsequent adult HOMA-IR or plasma adiponectin. Adult male-female differences in plasma leptin were lost with prior exposure to neonatal hypoxia or hypothermia; male-female differences in resistin were lost in the adults that were exposed to hypoxia and spontaneous hypothermia as neonates. Exposure of neonates to daily hypoxia without spontaneous hypothermia led to a decrease in plasma testosterone in adult male rats. We conclude that neonatal stressors result in subsequent adult sex-dependent increases in insulin resistance and adipokines and that our rat model of prematurity with hypoxia without hypothermia alters adult testosterone dynamics.",

Using a combination of approaches including a number of biophysical techniques, we show that there are two distinct actoxumab binding sites within the CROP domain of TcdA centered on identical amino acid sequences at residues 2162-2189 and 2410-2437. Actoxumab binding caused the aggregation of TcdA especially at higher antibody:toxin concentration ratios. Actoxumab prevented the association of TcdA with target cells demonstrating that actoxumab neutralizes toxin activity by inhibiting the first step of the intoxication cascade. This mechanism of neutralization is similar to that observed with bezlotoxumab and TcdB. Comparisons of the putative TcdA epitope sequences across several C. difficile ribotypes and homologous repeat sequences within TcdA suggest a structural basis for observed differences in actoxumab binding and/or neutralization potency. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the protective effects of the antibody in vitro and in vivo, including in various preclinical models of CDI.",

Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. In advanced and metastatic GC, conventional chemotherapy results in limited efficacy and the average survival rate is currently approximately 10 months. Dysregulated activation of numerous genes, including zinc finger, DHHC-type containing 14; caspase-associated recruitment domain-containing protein; and Ras association domain family member 10, have been implicated in GC. The tumor suppressor function of lactotransferrin (LTF) has been reported in a variety of tumors, including GC, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and prostate cancer. However, the mechanism of the tumor suppressor function of LTF in GC remains unclear. In the present study, the expression levels of LTF in patient GC tissue samples were investigated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and it was demonstrated that the LTF mRNA expression level in GC tissue samples was reduced by ~20-fold compared with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (t=4.56, P<0.01). A similar trend in LTF protein expression was observed by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway intermediates p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun were highly expressed in GC tissue samples, and indicated that LTF downregulation may be associated with the dysregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway in GC tissues. In addition, the present study indicated that LTF overexpression reduced the expression of p38, JNK2 and c-Jun in the GC cell line, SGC7901. The present study demonstrates that LTF expression is downregulated in GC tissues and that LTF may serve an important role in the dysregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway.",

BACKGROUND: Dental implants have been widely used to replace missing teeth, accomplishing aesthetics and function. Due to its large use worldwide, the small percentage of implant loss becomes significant in number of cases. Lactotransferrin (LTF) is a pleiotropic protein, expressed in various body tissues and fluids, which modulates the host immune-inflammatory response and bone metabolism, and might be involved in dental implant osseointegration. Recently, a few studies have been investigating genetic aspects underlying dental implant failure. PURPOSE: This case-control study aimed to investigate the association of genetic markers (tag SNPs) in LTF gene and clinical parameters with dental implant loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 278 patients, both sexes, mean age 51 years old, divided into 184 without and 94 with implant loss, were genotyped for sixteen tag SNPs, representative of the whole LTF gene. Also, clinical oral and systemic parameters were analyzed. Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression model were used to analyze the results (p < .05). RESULTS: No association was found between the tag SNPs and implant loss in the study population. Clinical association was found with medical treatment, hormonal reposition, edentulism, number of placed implants, plaque, calculus, and mobility.

Ten years after Fire and Melo's Nobel Prize for discovery of gene silencing by double-stranded RNA, a remarkable progress was achieved in RNA interference (RNAi). Changes in the chemical structure of synthetic oligonucleotides make them more stable and specific, and new delivery strategies became progressively available. The attention of pharmaceutical industry rapidly turned to RNAi, as an opportunity to explore new drug targets. This review addresses nine small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and one unique microRNA (miRNA) inhibitor, which entered the phase 2-3 clinical trials. The siRNAs in focus are PF-04523655, TKM-080301, Atu027, SYL040012, SYL1001, siG12D-LODER (phase 2), QPI-1002, QPI-1007, and patisiran (phase 3). Regarding miRNAs, their content can be down- or up-regulated, by using miRNA inhibitors (AntimiRs) or miRNA mimics. Miravirsen is an AntimiR-122 for hepatitis C virus infection. The flexibility of RNAi technology is easily understood taking into account: (i) the different drug targets (i.e. p53, caspase 2, PKN3, \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, mutated KRAS, microRNAs); (ii) therapeutic conditions, including ophthalmic diseases, kidney injury, amyloidosis, pancreatic cancer, viral hepatitis; and (iii) routes of administration (ocular, intravenous, subcutaneous, intratumoral).

We have created an open-access web service called PlantAPA (http://bmi.xmu.edu.cn/plantapa) to visualize and analyze genome-wide poly(A) sites in plants. PlantAPA provides various interactive and dynamic graphics and seamlessly integrates a genome browser that can profile heterogeneous cleavage sites and quantify expression patterns of poly(A) sites across different conditions. Particularly, through PlantAPA, users can analyze poly(A) sites in extended 3' UTR regions, intergenic regions, and ambiguous regions owing to alternative transcription or RNA processing. In addition, it also provides tools for analyzing poly(A) site selections, 3' UTR lengthening or shortening, non-canonical APA site switching, and differential gene expression between conditions, making it more powerful for the study of APA-mediated gene expression regulation. More importantly, PlantAPA offers a bioinformatics pipeline that allows users to upload their own short reads or ESTs for poly(A) site extraction, enabling users to further explore poly(A) site selection using stored PlantAPA poly(A) sites together with their own poly(A) site datasets. To date, PlantAPA hosts the largest database of APA sites in plants, including Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

Motivation: The length of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of an mRNA is essential for many biological activities such as mRNA stability, sub-cellular localization, protein translation, protein binding and translation efficiency. Moreover, correlation between diseases and the shortening (or lengthening) of 3' UTRs has been reported in the literature. This length is largely determined by the polyadenylation cleavage site in the mRNA. As alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites are common in mammalian genes, several tools have been published recently for detecting APA sites from RNA-Seq data or performing shortening/lengthening analysis. These tools consider either up to only two APA sites in a gene or only APA sites that occur in the last exon of a gene, although a gene may generally have more than two APA sites and an APA site may sometimes occur before the last exon. Furthermore, the tools are unable to integrate the analysis of shortening/lengthening events with APA site detection. Results: We propose a new tool, called TAPAS, for detecting novel APA sites from RNA-Seq data. It can deal with more than two APA sites in a gene as well as APA sites that occur before the last exon. The tool is based on an existing method for finding change points in time series data, but some filtration techniques are also adopted to remove change points that are likely false APA sites. It is then extended to identify APA sites that are expressed differently between two biological samples and genes that contain 3' UTRs with shortening/lengthening events. Our extensive experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq data demonstrate that TAPAS outperforms the existing tools for APA site detection or shortening/lengthening analysis significantly.

Multiple publically available pipelines combining high profiling technologies and bioinformatics tools have been developed to catalog changes in 3'-UTR lengths. In our recent RNA-seq experiments using cells with hyper-activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we found that cellular mTOR activation leads to transcriptome-wide alternative polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the activation of multiple cellular pathways. Here, we developed a novel bioinformatics algorithm, IntMAP, which integrates RNA-Seq and PolyA Site (PAS)-Seq data for a comprehensive characterization of APA events. By applying IntMAP to the datasets from cells with hyper-activated mTOR, we identified novel APA events that could otherwise not be identified by either profiling method alone. Several transcription factors including Cebpg (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma) were among the newly discovered APA transcripts, indicating that diverse transcriptional networks may be regulated by mTOR-coordinated APA. The prevention of APA in Cebpg using the CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome editing tool showed that mTOR-driven 3'-UTR shortening in Cebpg is critical in protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Taken together, we present IntMAP as a new bioinformatics algorithm for APA analysis by which we expand our understanding of the physiological role of mTOR-coordinated APA events to ER stress response.

In an elegant example of bench-to-bedside research, a hypothesis that cells in the outflow pathway actively regulate conventional outflow resistance was proposed in the 1990s and systematically pursued, exposing novel cellular and molecular mechanisms of intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation. The critical discovery that pharmacologic manipulation of the cytoskeleton of outflow pathway cells decreased outflow resistance placed a spotlight on the Rho kinase pathway that was known to regulate the cytoskeleton. Ultimately, a search for Rho kinase inhibitors led to the discovery of several molecules of therapeutic interest, leaving us today with 2 new ocular hypotensive agents approved for clinical use: ripasudil in Japan and netarsudil in the United States. These represent members of the first new class of clinically useful ocular hypotensive agents since the US Food and Drug Administration approval of latanoprost in 1996. The development of Rho kinase inhibitors as a class of medications to lower IOP in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension represents a triumph in translational research. Rho kinase inhibitors are effective alone or when combined with other known ocular hypotensive medications. They also offer the possibility of neuroprotective activity, a favorable impact on ocular blood flow, and even an antifibrotic effect that may prove useful in conventional glaucoma surgery. Local adverse effects, however, including conjunctival hyperemia, subconjunctival hemorrhages, and cornea verticillata, are common. Development of Rho kinase inhibitors targeted to the cells of the outflow pathway and the retina may allow these\u00a0agents to have even greater clinical impact.

PURPOSE: Netarsudil, an inhibitor of Rho kinase and a norepinephrine transporter, has been shown to lower elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in controlled studies of patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, and in healthy volunteers. The mechanism of this ocular hypotensive effect in humans is unknown. METHODS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of netarsudil 0.02% on aqueous humor dynamics (AHD) parameters. In this double-masked, vehicle-controlled, paired-eye comparison study, 11 healthy volunteers received topical netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% or its vehicle once daily for 7 days (morning dosing). The primary endpoints were the change in AHD parameters, compared between active and vehicle-treated eyes. RESULTS: In netarsudil-treated eyes, diurnal outflow facility increased from 0.27 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcL/min/mmHg to 0.33 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcL/min/mmHg (+22%; P = 0.02) after 7 days of treatment. In placebo-treated eyes, diurnal outflow facility did not significantly change (P = 0.94). The difference between netarsudil and placebo eyes in diurnal change of outflow facility was 0.08 \u03bcL/min/mmHg (P < 0.001). Diurnal episcleral venous pressure (EVP) in netarsudil-treated eyes decreased from 7.9 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg to 7.2 \u00b1 1.8 (-10%; P = 0.01). Diurnal EVP was not significantly different between netarsudil- and placebo-treated eyes. There was a trend toward decreasing aqueous humor flow rate (-15%; P = 0.08). No treatment changes were seen in uveoscleral outflow rate. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily dosing of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% lowered IOP through increasing trabecular outflow facility and reducing EVP.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and ocular and systemic safety of netarsudil 0.02% ophthalmic solution, a rho-kinase inhibitor and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor, in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. DESIGN: Double-masked, randomized noninferiority clinical trials: Rho Kinase Elevated IOP Treatment Trial 1 and 2 (ROCKET-1 and ROCKET-2). METHODS: After a washout of all pre-study ocular hypotensive medications, eligible patients were randomized to receive netarsudil 0.02% once daily (q.d.), timolol 0.5% twice a day (b.i.d.), and (ROCKET-2 only) netarsudil 0.02% b.i.d. Data through 3\u00a0months from both studies are provided in this report. RESULTS: Enrolled into the 2 studies were 1167 patients. Treatment with netarsudil q.d. produced clinically and statistically significant reductions from baseline intraocular pressure (P < .001), and was noninferior to timolol in the per-protocol population with maximum baseline IOP < 25\u00a0mm Hg in both studies (ROCKET-2, primary outcome measure and population, ROCKET-1, post hoc outcome measure). Netarsudil b.i.d. was also noninferior to timolol (ROCKET-2). The most frequent adverse event was conjunctival hyperemia, the incidence of which ranged from 50% (126/251, ROCKET-2) to 53% (108/203, ROCKET-1) for netarsudil q.d., 59% (149/253, ROCKET-2) for netarsudil b.i.d., and 8% (17/208, ROCKET-1) to 11% (27/251, ROCKET-2) for timolol (P < .0001 for netarsudil vs timolol). CONCLUSIONS: In 2 large, randomized, double-masked trials reported here, once-daily dosing of netarsudil 0.02% was found to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of patients with ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma. The novel pharmacology and aqueous humor dynamic effects of this molecule suggest it may be a useful addition to the armamentarium of ocular hypotensive medications.",

          "context": "Glaucomatous optic neuropathy treatment options: the promise of novel therapeutics, techniques and tools to help preserve vision. Peripheral vision loss followed by \"tunnel vision\" and eventual irreversible blindness is the fate of patients afflicted by various forms of glaucoma including primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and normotensive glaucoma (NTG). These complex and heterogeneous diseases are characterized by extensive death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) accompanied by retraction and severance of their axonal connections to the brain and thus damage to and thinning of the optic nerve. Since patients suffering from this glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) first notice visual impairment when they have lost > 40% of their RGCs, early diagnosis is the key to retard the progression of glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), low cerebrospinal and/or low intracranial fluid pressure, advancing age, and ethnicity are major risk factors associated with POAG. However, retinal vascular abnormalities and a high sensitivity of RGCs and optic nerve head components to neurotoxic, inflammatory, oxidative and mechanical insults also contribute to vision loss in POAG/GON. Current treatment modalities for POAG and NTG involve lowering IOP using topical ocular drugs, combination drug products, and surgical interventions. Two recently approved multi-pharmacophoric drugs (e.g., rho kinase inhibitor, Netarsudil; a drug conjugate, Latanoprostene Bunod) and novel aqueous humor drainage devices (iStent and CyPass) are also gaining acceptance for treating POAG/ NTG. Neuroprotective and regenerative agents, coupled with electroceutical, mechanical support systems, stem cell transplantation and gene therapy are emerging therapeutics on the horizon to help combat GON. The latter techniques and approaches hope to rejuvenate RGCs and repair the optic nerve structures, thereby providing a gain of function of the visual system for the glaucoma patients.",

Once-daily (p.m.) netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% (Rhopressa) is approved in the United States for lowering elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Netarsudil, a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that lowers IOP primarily by increasing trabecular outflow, produces statistically and clinically significant reductions in mean IOP from baseline, with comparable effects on nocturnal and diurnal IOP. In three phase III trials of patients with elevated IOP, the ocular hypotensive efficacy of once-daily netarsudil 0.02% met the criteria for noninferiority to twice-daily timolol 0.5% at all time points over 3 months in patients with baseline IOP less than 25 mmHg. The most frequent adverse event (AE) was generally mild conjunctival hyperemia, the severity of which did not increase with continued dosing. Netarsudil was associated with minimal treatment-related serious or systemic AEs, likely due to the lack of systemic exposure.

On May 23, 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a treatment for cancer patients with positive microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) markers or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) markers. This approach is the first approved tumor treatment using a common biomarker rather than specified tumor locations in the body. FDA previously approved Keytruda for treatment of several types of malignancies, such as metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma, all of which carry positive programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 biomarkers. Therefore, indications of Keytruda significantly expanded. Several types of malignancies are disclosed by MSI-H status due to dMMR and characterized by increased neoantigen load, which elicits intense host immune response in tumor microenvironment, including portions of colorectal and gastric carcinomas. Currently, biomarker-based patient selection remains a challenge. Pathologists play important roles in evaluating histology and biomarker results and establishing detection methods. Taking gastric cancer as an example, its molecular classification is built on genome abnormalities, but it lacks acceptable clinical characteristics. Pathologists are expected to act as \"genetic interpreters\" or \"genetic translators\" and build a link between molecular subtypes with tumor histological features. Subsequently, by using their findings, oncologists will carry out targeted therapy based on molecular classification.",
