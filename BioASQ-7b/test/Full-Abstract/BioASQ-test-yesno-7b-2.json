Data on the pharmacological treatment of trichotillomania are limited, with no clear first-line agent. The aim of the current study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of inositol in adults with trichotillomania. A total of 38 individuals (35 women; mean age: 28.9\u00b111.4) with trichotillomania entered a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of inositol (dosing ranging from 6 to 18 g/day). Patients were assessed using the Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Pulling Scale, the NIMH Trichotillomania Severity Scale, Clinical Global Impression Scale, and measures of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial functioning. Outcomes were examined using a linear mixed-effects model. Patients assigned to inositol failed to show significantly greater reductions on primary or secondary outcomes measures compared with placebo (all P>0.05). At study endpoint, 42.1% of patients were 'much or very much improved' on inositol compared with 35.3% on placebo. This is the first study assessing the efficacy of inositol in the treatment of trichotillomania, but found no differences in symptom reductions between inositol and placebo. Future studies should examine whether inositol may be beneficial in controlling pulling behavior in a subgroup of individuals with trichotillomania.",

Lucatumumab is a fully humanized anti-CD40 antibody that blocks interaction of CD40L with CD40 and also mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). We evaluated lucatumumab in a phase I clinical trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Twenty-six patients with relapsed CLL were enrolled on five different dose cohorts administered weekly for 4 weeks. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of lucatumumab was 3.0 mg/kg. Four patients at doses of 4.5 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg experienced grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic elevated amylase and lipase levels. Of the 26 patients enrolled, 17 patients had stable disease (mean duration of 76 days, range 29-504 days) and one patient had a nodular partial response for 230 days. Saturation of CD40 receptor on CLL cells was uniform at all doses post-treatment but also persisted at trough time points in the 3.0 mg/kg or greater cohorts. At the MTD, the median half-life of lucatumumab was 50 h following the first infusion, and 124 h following the fourth infusion. In summary, lucatumumab had acceptable tolerability, pharmacokinetics that supported chronic dosing and pharmacodynamic target antagonism at doses of 3.0 mg/kg, but demonstrated minimal single-agent activity. Future efforts with lucatumumab in CLL should focus on combination-based therapy.",

PURPOSE: Increased mitogenic signaling and angiogenesis, frequently facilitated by somatic activation of EGF receptor (EGFR; ErbB1) and/or loss of PTEN, and VEGF overexpression, respectively, drive malignant glioma growth. We hypothesized that patients with recurrent glioblastoma would exhibit differential antitumor benefit based on tumor PTEN/EGFRvIII status when treated with the antiangiogenic agent pazopanib and the ErbB inhibitor lapatinib. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A phase II study evaluated the antitumor activity of pazopanib 400 mg/d plus lapatinib 1,000 mg/d in patients with grade 4 malignant glioma and known PTEN/EGFRvIII status not receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (EIAC). The phase II study used a two-stage Green-Dahlberg design for futility. An independent, parallel phase I component determined the maximum-tolerated regimen (MTR) of pazopanib and lapatinib in patients with grade 3/4 glioma receiving EIACs. RESULTS: The six-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates in phase II (n = 41) were 0% and 15% in the PTEN/EGFRvIII-positive and PTEN/EGFRvIII-negative cohorts, respectively, leading to early termination. Two patients (5%) had a partial response and 14 patients (34%) had stable disease lasting 8 or more weeks. In phase I (n = 34), the MTR was not reached. On the basis of pharmacokinetic and safety review, a regimen of pazopanib 600 mg plus lapatinib 1,000 mg, each twice daily, was considered safe. Concomitant EIACs reduced exposure to pazopanib and lapatinib. CONCLUSIONS: The antitumor activity of this combination at the phase II dose tested was limited. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that exposure to lapatinib was subtherapeutic in the phase II evaluation. Evaluation of intratumoral drug delivery and activity may be essential for hypothesis-testing trials with targeted agents in malignant glioma.",

Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5 promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that GRG5 has pleiotropic roles in stem cell biology functioning as a stemness factor and a neural fate specifier.",

A majority of the effort has been concentrated on targeting gene mutations or pathway activations with precision therapeutics. Enasidenib is beneficial in a patient population that previously had limited treatment options. However, given the fact that enasidenib is a highly specific inhibitor of an early stable mutation, it is questionable whether a strategy of targeting a single mutation or pathway in relapsed AML will allow for better than the 20% complete remission (CR) rate observed with this therapy.

Collagen is a fibrillar protein that conforms the conjunctive and connective tissues in the human body, essentially skin, joints, and bones. This molecule is one of the most abundant in many of the living organisms due to its connective role in biological structures. Due to its abundance, strength and its directly proportional relation with skin aging, collagen has gained great interest in the cosmetic industry. It has been established that the collagen fibers are damaged with the pass of time, losing thickness and strength which has been strongly related with skin aging phenomena [Col\u00e1geno para todo. 60 y m\u00e1s. 2016. http://www.revista60ymas.es/InterPresent1/groups/revistas/documents/binario/ses330informe.pdf.]. As a solution, the cosmetic industry incorporated collagen as an ingredient of different treatments to enhance the user youth and well-being, and some common presentations are creams, nutritional supplement for bone and cartilage regeneration, vascular and cardiac reconstruction, skin replacement, and augmentation of soft skin among others [J App Pharm Sci. 2015;5:123-127]. Nowadays, the biomolecule can be obtained by extraction from natural sources such as plants and animals or by recombinant protein production systems including yeast, bacteria, mammalian cells, insects or plants, or artificial fibrils that mimic collagen characteristics like the artificial polymer commercially named as KOD. Because of its increased use, its market size is valued over USD 6.63 billion by 2025 [Collagen Market By Source (Bovine, Porcine, Poultry, Marine), Product (Gelatin, Hydrolyzed Collagen), Application (Food & Beverages, Healthcare, Cosmetics), By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2014 - 2025.

Glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline (Hyp) contribute to 57% of total amino acids (AAs) in collagen, which accounts for one-third of proteins in animals. As the most abundant protein in the body, collagen is essential to maintain the normal structure and strength of connective tissue, such as bones, skin, cartilage, and blood vessels. Mammals, birds, and fish can synthesize: (1) glycine from threonine, serine, choline, and Hyp; (2) proline from arginine; and (3) Hyp from proline residues in collagen, in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. In addition, livestock (e.g., pigs, cattle, and sheep) produces proline from glutamine and glutamate in the small intestine, but this pathway is absent from birds and possibly most fish species. Results of the recent studies indicate that endogenous synthesis of glycine, proline, and Hyp is inadequate for maximal growth, collagen production, or feed efficiency in pigs, chickens, and fish. Although glycine, proline and Hyp, and gelatin can be used as feed additives in animal diets, these ingredients except for glycine are relatively expensive, which precludes their inclusion in practical rations. Alternatively, hydrolyzed feather meal (HFM), which contains 9% glycine, 5% Hyp, and 12% proline, holds great promise as a low cost but abundant dietary source of glycine, Hyp, and proline for ruminants and nonruminants. Because HFM is deficient in most AAs, future research efforts should be directed at improving the bioavailability of its AAs and the balance of AAs in HFM-supplemented diets. Finally, HFM may be used as a feed additive to prevent or ameliorate connective tissue disorders in domestic and aquatic animals.",

Cancer genome sequencing projects have identified hundreds of genetic alterations, often at low frequencies, raising questions as to their functional relevance. One exemplar gene is HUWE1, which has been found to be mutated in numerous studies. However, due to the large size of this gene and a lack of functional analysis of identified mutations, their significance to carcinogenesis is unclear. To determine the importance of HUWE1, we chose to examine its function in colorectal cancer, where it is mutated in up to 15 per cent of tumours. Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins.",

To investigate the impact of deletion of Gpx1 on Se metabolism, Se flux, and apparent Se requirements, KO, Gpx1 heterozygous (Het), and Gpx1 wild-type (WT) mice were fed Se-deficient diet for 17\u00a0weeks, then repleted with graded levels of Se (0-0.3\u00a0\u03bcg Se/g as NaSeO) for 7\u00a0days, and selenoprotein activities and transcripts were determined in blood, liver, and kidney. Se deficiency decreased the activities of plasma Gpx3, liver Gpx1, liver Txnrd, and liver Gpx4 to 3, 0.3, 11, and 50% of WT Se-adequate levels, respectively, but the Gpx1 genotype had no effect on growth or changes in activity or expression of selenoproteins other than Gpx1. Se repletion increased selenoprotein transcripts to Se-adequate levels after 7\u00a0days; Se response curves and apparent Se requirements for selenoprotein transcripts were similar to those observed in studies starting with Se-adequate mice. With short-term Se repletion, selenoenzyme activities resulted in three Se response curve patterns: (1) liver and kidney Gpx1, Gpx4, and Txnrd activities were sigmoidal or hyperbolic with breakpoints (0.08-0.19\u00a0\u03bcg Se/g) that were double those observed in studies starting with Se-adequate mice; (2) red blood cell Gpx1 activity was not significantly changed; and (3) plasma Gpx3 activity only increased substantially with 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg Se/g. Plasma Gpx3 is secreted from kidney. In this short-term study, kidney Gpx3 mRNA reached plateau levels at 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg Se/g, and other kidney selenoenzyme activities reached plateau levels at < \u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcg Se/g, so sufficient Se should have been present in kidney. Thus, the delayed increase in plasma Gpx3 activity suggests that newly synthesized and secreted kidney Gpx3 is preferentially retained in kidney or rapidly cleared by binding to basement membranes in kidney or in other tissues.

The gonadal tissue, with abundance of highly unsaturated fatty acids, high rates of cell division, and variety of testis enzymes results very vulnerable to the overexpression of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In order to address this risk, testis has developed a sophisticated array of antioxidant systems comprising both enzymes and free radical scavengers. This chapter sets out the major pathways of testis generation, the metabolism of ROS, and highlights the transcriptional regulation by steroid receptors of antioxidant stress enzymes and their functional implications. It also deals with of the advantages of the system biology for an antioxidant under steroid control, the major selenoprotein expressed by germ cells in the testis, the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx/GPx4) having multiple functions and representing the pivotal link between selenium, sperm quality, and species preservation.",

The selenoenzyme Gpx4 is essential for early embryogenesis and cell viability for its unique function to prevent phospholipid oxidation. Recently, the cytosolic form of Gpx4 was identified as an upstream regulator of a novel form of non-apoptotic cell death, called ferroptosis, whereas the mitochondrial isoform of Gpx4 was previously shown to be crucial for male fertility. Here, we generated and analyzed mice with a targeted mutation of the active site selenocysteine of Gpx4 (Gpx4_U46S). Mice homozygous for Gpx4_U46S died at the same embryonic stage (E7.5) as Gpx4(-/-) embryos as expected. Surprisingly, male mice heterozygous for Gpx4_U46S presented subfertility. Subfertility was manifested in a reduced number of litters from heterozygous breeding and an impairment of spermatozoa to fertilize oocytes in vitro. Morphologically, sperm isolated from heterozygous Gpx4_U46S mice revealed many structural abnormalities particularly in the spermatozoa midpiece due to improper oxidation and polymerization of sperm capsular proteins and malformation of the mitochondrial capsule surrounding and stabilizing sperm mitochondria. These findings are reminiscent of sperm isolated from selenium-deprived rodents or from mice specifically lacking mitochondrial Gpx4. Due to a strongly facilitated incorporation of Ser in the polypeptide chain as compared with selenocysteine at the UGA codon, expression of the catalytically inactive Gpx4_U46S was found to be strongly increased. Because the stability of the mitochondrial capsule of mature spermatozoa depends on the moonlighting function of Gpx4 both as an enzyme oxidizing capsular protein thiols and as a structural protein, tightly controlled expression of functional Gpx4 emerges as a key for full male fertility.",

We demonstrate that TIAM1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus antagonizing TAZ/YAP by distinct mechanisms in the two compartments. In the cytoplasm, TIAM1 localizes to the destruction complex and promotes TAZ degradation by enhancing its interaction with \u03b2TrCP. Nuclear TIAM1 suppresses TAZ/YAP interaction with TEADs, inhibiting expression of TAZ/YAP target genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and invasion, and consequently suppresses CRC cell migration and invasion.

Bacterial pathogens recruit circulating proteins to their own surfaces, co-opting the host protein functions as a mechanism of virulence. Particular attention has focused on the binding of plasminogen (Plg) to bacterial surfaces, as it has been shown that this interaction contributes to bacterial adhesion to host cells, invasion of host tissues, and evasion of the immune system. Several bacterial proteins are known to serve as receptors for Plg including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a cytoplasmic enzyme that appears on the cell surface in this moonlighting role. Although Plg typically binds to these receptors via several lysine-binding domains, the specific interactions that occur have not been documented in all cases. However, identification of the relevant residues could help define strategies for mitigating the virulence of important human pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp). To shed light on this question, we have described a combination of peptide-spot array screening, competition and SPR assays, high-resolution crystallography, and mutational analyses to characterize the interaction between SpGAPDH and Plg. We identified three SpGAPDH lysine residues that were instrumental in defining the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction. Altogether, the integration of the data presented in this work allows us to propose a structural model for the molecular interaction of the SpGAPDH-Plg complex.",

A systematic literature search of three databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Embase) was performed. Human clinical trials assessing treatment strategies, published in the last 5 yr, were included based on full-text analysis. Study data were extracted using tables depicting study type, sample size, and outcome variables. We identified 49 studies meeting our inclusion criteria.

Cilostazol, eicosapentaenoic acid, erythropoietin, heparin, and methylprednisolone yield promising results in smaller, non-randomized or retrospective studies and warrant further investigation. Topical application of nicardipine via implants after clipping has been shown to reduce clinical and angiographic vasospasm. Methods to improve subarachnoid blood clearance have been established, but their effect on outcome remains unclear. Haemodynamic management of DCI is evolving towards euvolaemic hypertension. Endovascular rescue therapies, such as percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty and intra-arterial spasmolysis, are able to resolve angiographic vasospasm, but their effect on outcome needs to be proved. Many novel therapies for preventing and treating DCI after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage have been assessed, with variable results.

METHODS: PubMed, EMbase, Web of science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of simvastatin versus placebo on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were included. Two investigators independently searched articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. The primary outcomes were delayed ischaemic deficit and delayed cerebral infarction.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the effect of high-dose simvastatin on cerebral vasospasm and its clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in Korean patients. METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective observational cohort study. Its subjects were aneurysmal SAH patients who had undergone aneurysm clipping or coiling. They were assigned to 1 of 3 groups : the 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg simvastatin groups. The primary end-point was the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm. The clinical outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score after 1 month and 3 months. The risk factors of the development of vasospasm were assessed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Ninety nine patients with aneurysmal SAH were treated and screened. They were sequentially assigned to the 20 mg (n=22), 40 mg (n=34), and 80 mg (n=31) simvastatin groups.

The purpose of this review is to analyze the recent literature and improve our understanding of certain key clinical aspects. RECENT FINDINGS: Growing body of evidence highlights the usefulness of CT perfusion scans in the diagnosis of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Hypervolemia leads to worse cardiopulmonary outcomes and does not improve DCI. The traditional triple H therapy is falling out of favor with hemodynamic augmentation alone now considered the mainstay of medical management. Randomized controlled trials have shown that simvastatin and intravenous magnesium do not prevent DCI or improve functional outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Emerging data using multimodality monitoring has further advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCI in poor grade aSAH.

OBJECTIVES: Experimental evidence has indicated the benefit of simvastatin in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Recently, acute simvastatin treatment was not shown to be beneficial in neurological outcome using modified Rankin Scale. Cognitive function is another important dimension of outcome assessment and yet had not been investigated in statin studies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We therefore explored whether acute simvastatin treatment would improve cognitive outcomes. METHODS: The study recruited SAH patients with acute simvastatin treatment enrolled in a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01038193). A control cohort of SAH patients without simvastatin treatment was identified with propensity score matching of age and admission grade. Primary outcome measure was Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary outcome measures were delayed ischaemic deficit (DID), delayed cerebral infarction, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: Fifty-one SAH patients with acute simvastatin treatment and 51 SAH patients without simvastatin treatment were recruited for analysis. At 3 months, there were no differences in MoCA scores (MoCA: 21+/-6 vs. 21+/-5, p=0.772). MoCA-assessed cognitive impairment (MoCA<26) was not different (75% vs. 80%, OR 0.7, 95%CI 0.3 to 1.8, p=0.477). There were also no differences in DID, delayed cerebral infarction, favorable mRS outcome, and MMSE scores, and MMSE-assessed cognitive impairment between both groups.

This study evaluated the preventive effects of RB supplementation on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and associated metabolic abnormalities induced by high fat diet (HFD). Wild-type male mice (six weeks old) were randomized into 4 groups receiving a control or typical western HFD supplemented with or without 5% freeze-dried RB for 12 weeks, when mice were sacrificed for tissue collection. HFD feeding substantially increased body weight, which was alleviated by RB supplementation towards the end of the feeding trial. Dietary RB restored the baseline blood glucose level, ameliorating glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, which were aggravated by HFD. Additionally, HFD reduced O expenditure and CO production, which were ameliorated by RB consumption. The liver is the key site for energy metabolism and a key peripheral tissue responsive to insulin. RB supplementation reduced hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD mice. In agreement, RB consumption suppressed hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 production in HFD mice, accompanied with normalized mitochondriogenesis. These results suggest that RB consumption improves insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in diet-induced obesity, which is concomitant with suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome elicited by HFD.

This similarity is irrespective of promoter CpG content.

Moreover, in vitro MSC differentiation does not affect lineage-specific promoter methylation states, arguing that these methylation patterns in differentiated cells are already established at the progenitor stage. Further, we find a correlation between lineage-specific promoter hypermethylation and lack of differentiation capacity toward that lineage, but no relationship between weak promoter methylation and capacity of transcriptional activation or differentiation. Thus, only part of the restriction in differentiation capacity of tissue-specific stem cells is programmed by promoter DNA methylation: hypermethylation seems to constitute a barrier to differentiation, however, no or weak methylation has no predictive value for differentiation potential.",

The one of the main purposes of research was to evaluate the comparative data of the MSC transplantation with (5-azacytidine) and without commitment and to assess the post transplantation effects. METHODS: The efficiency of intravenous cardiomyoplasty by infusion of MSC was evaluated in female Wistar-Kyoto rats with myocardial infarction model using echocardiography, morphological study, morphometry, immunohistostaining, data from in situ hybridization, and by measurement of blood serum levels of nitric oxide, endothelin-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). RESULTS: The transplanted MSC were detected in all layers of the myocardium; MCS actively participate in the formation of blood vessels and connective tissue in the scar zone. There was no observable differentiation of male MSC into cardiomyocytes in female rats with MI. However, MSC transplantation leads to significant improvement in vascularization in the area of MI, elevation blood serum levels of nitric oxide, VEGF, and FGF2. No significant differences were identified morphologically between the two groups of animals after transplantation with unmodified MSC or commited MSC (5-azaC). CONCLUSION: Intravenous transplantation of MSC without commitment in rats with MI improves the contractile function of the heart, the morphology of the myocardium, and should be recommended for further clinical investigation as an alternative approach to deal with heart diseases.",

Protein ubiquitination is critical for regulation of numerous eukaryotic cellular processes such as protein homeostasis, cell cycle progression, immune response, DNA repair, and vesicular trafficking. Ubiquitination often leads to the alteration of protein stability, subcellular localization, or interaction with other proteins. Given the importance of ubiquitination in the regulation of host immunity, it is not surprising that many infectious agents have evolved strategies to interfere with the ubiquitination network with sophisticated mechanisms such as functional mimicry. The facultative intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. L. pneumophila is phagocytosed by macrophages and is able to replicate within a niche called Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). The biogenesis of LCV is dependent upon the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system which delivers more than 330 effector proteins into host cytosol. The optimal intracellular replication of L. pneumophila requires the host ubiquitin-proteasome system. Furthermore, membranes of the bacterial phagosome are enriched with ubiquitinated proteins in a way that requires its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system, suggesting the involvement of effectors in the manipulation of the host ubiquitination machinery. Here we summarize recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms exploited by L. pneumophila effector proteins to hijack the host ubiquitination pathway.",

Phagosomes undergo multiple rounds of fusion with compartments of the endocytic pathway during the course of maturation. Despite the insertion of vast amounts of additional membrane, the phagosomal surface area remains approximately constant, implying active ongoing fission. To investigate the mechanisms underlying phagosomal fission we monitored the fate of Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR), which are known to be cleared from the phagosome during maturation. FcgammaR, which show a continuous distribution throughout the membrane of nascent phagosomes were found at later times to cluster into punctate, vesicular structures, before disappearing. In situ photoactivation of receptors tagged with a light-sensitive fluorescent protein revealed that some of these vesicles detach, whereas others remain associated with the phagosome. By fusing FcgammaR to pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins, we observed that the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors enters an acidic compartment, indicative of inward budding and formation of multivesicular structures. The topology of the receptor was confirmed by flow cytometry of purified phagosomes. Phagosomal proteins are ubiquitylated, and ubiquitylation was found to be required for formation of acidic multivesicular structures. Remarkably, proteasomal function is also involved in the vesiculation process. Preventing the generation of multivesicular structures did not impair the acquisition of late endosomal and lysosomal markers, indicating that phagosomal fusion and fission are controlled separately.",

BACKGROUND: New therapeutic strategies for malignant mesothelioma are urgently needed. In the DETERMINE study, we investigated the effects of the cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody tremelimumab in patients with previously treated advanced malignant mesothelioma. METHODS: DETERMINE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial done at 105 study centres across 19 countries in patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who had progressed after one or two previous systemic treatments for advanced disease. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease as defined in the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 for pleural mesothelioma or RECIST version 1.1 for peritoneal mesothelioma. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) in blocks of three, stratified by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer status (low risk vs high risk), line of therapy (second line vs third line), and anatomic site (pleural vs peritoneal), by use of an interactive voice or web system, to receive intravenous tremelimumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 7 doses and every 12 weeks thereafter until a treatment discontinuation criterion was met. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is ongoing but no longer recruiting participants, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01843374. FINDINGS: Between May 17, 2013, and Dec 4, 2014, 571 patients were randomly assigned to receive tremelimumab (n=382) or placebo (n=189), of whom 569 patients received treatment (two patients in the tremelimumab group were excluded from the safety population because they did not receive treatment). At the data cutoff date (Jan 24, 2016), 307 (80%) of 382 patients had died in the tremelimumab group and 154 (81%) of 189 patients had died in the placebo group. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population did not differ between the treatment groups: 7\u00b77 months (95% CI 6\u00b78-8\u00b79) in the tremelimumab group and 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b79-8\u00b77) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0\u00b792 [95% CI 0\u00b776-1\u00b712], p=0\u00b741). Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 246 (65%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 91 (48%) of 189 patients in the placebo group; the most common were dyspnoea (34 [9%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs 27 [14%] patients in the placebo group), diarrhoea (58 [15%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (26 [7%] vs none). The most common serious adverse events were diarrhoea (69 [18%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs one [<1%] patient in the placebo group), dyspnoea (29 [8%] vs 24 [13%]), and colitis (24 [6%] vs none). Treatment-emergent events leading to death occurred in 36 (9%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 12 (6%) of 189 in the placebo group; those leading to the death of more than one patient were mesothelioma (three [1%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs two [1%] in the placebo group), dyspnoea (three [1%] vs two [1%]); respiratory failure (one [<1%] vs three [2%]), myocardial infarction (three [1%] vs none), lung infection (three [1%] patients vs none), cardiac failure (one [<1%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis (two [<1%] vs none). Treatment-related adverse events leading to death occurred in five (1%) patients in the tremelimumab group and none in the placebo group. The causes of death were lung infection in one patient, intestinal perforation and small intestinal obstruction in one patient; colitis in two patients, and neuritis and skin ulcer in one patient. INTERPRETATION: Tremelimumab did not significantly prolong overall survival compared with placebo in patients with previously treated malignant mesothelioma.

BACKGROUND: Tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody, initially showed good activity when used alone in patients with mesothelioma, but did not improve the overall survival of patients who failed on first-line or second-line chemotherapy compared with placebo in the DETERMINE study. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of first-line or second-line tremelimumab combined with durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with malignant mesothelioma. METHODS: In this open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial, patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma received intravenous tremelimumab (1 mg/kg bodyweight) and durvalumab (20 mg/kg bodyweight) every 4 weeks for four doses, followed by maintenance intravenous durvalumab at the same dose and schedule for nine doses. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an immune-related objective response according to the immune-related modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; for pleural mesothelioma) or immune-related RECIST version 1.1 (for peritoneal mesothelioma). The primary analysis was done by intention to treat, whereas the safety analysis included patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2015-001995-23, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02588131, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients. FINDINGS: From Oct 30, 2015, to Oct 12, 2016, 40 patients with mesothelioma were enrolled and received at least one dose each of tremelimumab and durvalumab. Patients were followed-up for a median of 19\u00b72 months (IQR 13\u00b78-20\u00b75). 11 (28%) of 40 patients had an immune-related objective response (all partial responses; confirmed in ten patients), with a median response duration of 16\u00b71 months (IQR 11\u00b75-20\u00b75). 26 (65%) patients had immune-related disease control and 25 (63%) had disease control. Median immune-related progression-free survival was 8\u00b70 months (95% CI 6\u00b77-9\u00b73), median progression-free survival was 5\u00b77 months (1\u00b77-9\u00b77), and median overall survival was 16\u00b76 months (13\u00b71-20\u00b71). Baseline tumour PD-L1 expression did not correlate with the proportion of patients who had an immune-related objective response or immune-related disease control, with immune-related progression-free survival, or with overall survival. 30 (75%) patients experienced treatment-related adverse events of any grade, of whom seven (18%) had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events.

PURPOSE: CPX-351 is a novel liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin which has recently been FDA approved for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The current study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this liposomal formulation. METHODS: CPX-351 PK data (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and metabolites) from a phase I study of relapsed and refractory AML were used for the analysis. Therapy was given days 1, 3, and 5 of induction (3-134 units/m). We developed a population PK model to characterize CPX-351 disposition. RESULTS: 39 patients (3589 samples) were evaluated. Liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin were modeled separately with their respective metabolites. A one-compartment model fit the parent compounds well; the metabolites required two-compartment models. Weight was an independent predictor of liposomal volumes; mild renal and liver dysfunction were not predictors of clearance or volume (maximum creatinine 1.6\u00a0mg/dL and total bilirubin 1.8\u00a0mg/dL). Liposomal clearances of the two drugs were highly correlated and 1000-fold smaller than published non-encapsulated values supporting prolonged encapsulation in the liposome. CONCLUSIONS: The PK model demonstrates prolonged exposure to cytarabine and daunorubicin without increases in non-hematologic toxicity that indicates retention of the drugs within the liposome.

BACKGROUND: Combination chemotherapy has shown benefit in the treatment of biliary cancer and further improvements might be achieved by the addition of a biological agent. We report here the effect of chemotherapy with the monoclonal EGFR antibody panitumumab as therapy for KRAS wild-type biliary cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer were randomised (2:1) to receive cisplatin 25\u00a0mg/m and gemcitabine 1000\u00a0mg/m on day 1 and day 8/q3w with (arm A) or without panitumumab (arm B; 9\u00a0mg/kg BW, i.v q3w). The primary end-point was the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months. Secondary end-points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. In addition, a post hoc assessment of genetic alterations was performed. Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of trials with chemotherapy with and without EGFR antibodies. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomised in arm A and 28 patients in arm B. Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765). PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively. Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively. In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival. In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone. CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.

Preclinical data suggest that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway could be involved in its progression. METHODS: This open-label, randomized phase 2 trial recruited chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced BTC displaying a wild-type (WT) KRAS status. Patients were randomized to gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) ) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2) ) with (arm A) or without (arm B) panitumumab (6 mg/kg) for up to 12 cycles.

No survival differences were observed: the median overall survival was 9.9 months in arm A and 10.2 months in arm B (P = .42). In a subgroup analysis, no differences in PFS according to the site of the primary tumor were observed; patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with panitumumab may have had a survival benefit in comparison with the control group (15.1 vs 11.8 months, P = .13).

We report results of model validation in an independent prospective national household sample of 1056 respondents with lifetime MDD at baseline. The WMH ML models were applied to these baseline data to generate predicted outcome scores that were compared with observed scores assessed 10-12 years after baseline. ML model prediction accuracy was also compared with that of conventional logistic regression models. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve based on ML (0.63 for high chronicity and 0.71-0.76 for the other prospective outcomes) was consistently higher than for the logistic models (0.62-0.70) despite the latter models including more predictors. A total of 34.6-38.1% of respondents with subsequent high persistence chronicity and 40.8-55.8% with the severity indicators were in the top 20% of the baseline ML-predicted risk distribution, while only 0.9% of respondents with subsequent hospitalizations and 1.5% with suicide attempts were in the lowest 20% of the ML-predicted risk distribution. These results confirm that clinically useful MDD risk-stratification models can be generated from baseline patient self-reports and that ML methods improve on conventional methods in developing such models.",

INTRODUCTION: The heterogeneity of symptoms and complex etiology of depression pose a significant challenge to the personalization of treatment. Meanwhile, the current application of generic treatment approaches to patients with vastly differing biological and clinical profiles is far from optimal. Here, we conduct a meta-review to identify predictors of response to antidepressant therapy in order to select robust input features for machine learning models of treatment response. These machine learning models will allow us to learn associations between patient features and treatment response which have predictive value at the individual patient level; this learning can be optimized by selecting high-quality input features for the model. While current research is difficult to directly apply to the clinic, machine learning models built using knowledge gleaned from current research may become useful clinical tools. METHODS: The EMBASE and MEDLINE/PubMed online databases were searched from January 1996 to August 2017, using a combination of MeSH terms and keywords to identify relevant literature reviews. We identified a total of 1909 articles, wherein 199 articles met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: An array of genetic, immune, endocrine, neuroimaging, sociodemographic, and symptom-based predictors of treatment response were extracted, varying widely in clinical utility. LIMITATIONS: Due to heterogeneous sample sizes, effect sizes, publication biases, and methodological disparities across reviews, we could not accurately assess the strength and directionality of every predictor. CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding our cautious interpretation of the results, we have identified a multitude of predictors that can be used to formulate a priori hypotheses regarding the input features for a computational model. We highlight the importance of large-scale research initiatives and clinically accessible biomarkers, as well as the need for replication studies of current findings. In addition, we provide recommendations for future improvement and standardization of research efforts in this field.",

We also included data from a small yet completely independent cohort RIS-INT-93 as an external test dataset. We used features from enrollment and level 1 treatment (up to week 2 response only) of STAR*D to explore the feature space comprehensively and applied machine learning methods to model TRD outcome at level 2. For TRD defined using QIDS-C16 remission criteria, multiple machine learning models were internally cross-validated in the STAR*D training dataset and externally validated in both the STAR*D testing dataset and RIS-INT-93 independent dataset with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.70-0.78 and 0.72-0.77, respectively. The upper bound for the AUC achievable with the full set of features could be as high as 0.78 in the STAR*D testing dataset.

In addition, the model developed using overlapping features between STAR*D and RIS-INT-93, achieved an AUC of > 0.70 in both the STAR*D testing and RIS-INT-93 datasets. Among all the features explored in STAR*D and RIS-INT-93 datasets, the most important feature was early or initial treatment response or symptom severity at week 2.

It was hypothesized that EEG-based SL features could discriminate MDD patients and healthy controls with an acceptable accuracy better than measures such as interhemispheric coherence and mutual information. In this work, classification models such as support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR) and Na\u00efve Bayesian (NB) were employed to model relationship between the EEG features and the study groups (MDD patient and healthy controls) and ultimately achieved discrimination of study participants. The results indicated that the classification rates were better than chance. More specifically, the study resulted into SVM classification accuracy\u00a0=\u00a098%, sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a099.9%, specificity\u00a0=\u00a095% and f-measure\u00a0=\u00a00.97; LR classification accuracy\u00a0=\u00a091.7%, sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a086.66%, specificity\u00a0=\u00a096.6% and f-measure\u00a0=\u00a00.90; NB classification accuracy\u00a0=\u00a093.6%, sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a0100%, specificity\u00a0=\u00a087.9% and f-measure\u00a0=\u00a00.95.

In this open-label, multicentre, phase 1 study a fully human anti-CD40 antagonist monoclonal antibody, lucatumumab, was evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antimyeloma activity. Twenty-eight patients, enrolled using a standard '3\u00a0+\u00a03' dose escalation, received one or two (n\u00a0=\u00a03) cycles of lucatumumab 1\u00b70, 3\u00b70, 4\u00b75 or 6\u00b70\u00a0mg/kg once weekly for 4\u00a0weeks. Common lucatumumab-related adverse events were reversible, mild-to-moderate infusion reactions. Severe adverse events were anaemia, chills, hypercalcaemia and pyrexia (7% each). DLTs included grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 increased alanine aminotransferase and grade 4 increased lipase (n\u00a0=\u00a01 each). The MTD was 4\u00b75\u00a0mg/kg. At doses > 3\u00b70\u00a0mg/kg, sustained receptor occupancy ( > 87%), observed throughout weekly infusions up to 5\u00a0weeks after the last infusion, correlated with an estimated half-life of 4-19\u00a0d. Twelve patients (43%) had stable disease, and one patient (4%) maintained a partial response for > 8\u00a0months.

BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have shown that lithium modifies pathological cascades implicated in certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntigton`s disease (HD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A critical question is whether these pharmacodynamic properties of lithium translate into neurodegenerative diseases modifying effects in human subjects. METHODS: We reviewed all English controlled clinical trials published in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, SCOPUS, ISI-Web with the use of lithium for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders between July 2004 and July 2014. RESULTS: Lithium showed evidence for positive effects on cognitive functions and biomarkers in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, 1 study) and AD (2 studies), even with doses lower than those used for mood stabilisation. Studies of Li in HD, MSA and CSI did not show benefits of lithium. However, due to methodological limitations and small sample size, these studies may be inconclusive. Studies in ALS showed consistently negative results and presented evidence against the use of lithium for the treatment of this disease. CONCLUSION: In absence of disease modifying treatments for any neurodegenerative disorders, the fact that at least 3 studies supported the effect of lithium in aMCI/AD is noteworthy. Future studies should focus on defining the dose range necessary for neuroprotective effects to occur.",

Therefore, riluzole remains the only directly disease-modifying drug. In addition, we discuss antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a new and potentially causal treatment option. Progress in symptomatic treatments has been more important. Nutrition and ventilation are now an important focus of ALS therapy. Several studies have firmly established that noninvasive ventilation improves patients' quality of life and prolongs survival. On the other hand, there is still no consensus regarding best nutritional management, but big multicenter trials addressing this issue are currently ongoing. Evidence regarding secondary symptoms like spasticity, muscle cramps or sialorrhea remains generally scarce, but some new insights will also be discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether genetic subgroups in recent amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) trials responded to treatment with lithium carbonate, but that the treatment effect was lost in a large cohort of nonresponders. METHODS: Individual participant data were obtained from 3 randomized trials investigating the efficacy of lithium carbonate. We matched clinical data with data regarding the UNC13A and C9orf72 genotype. Our primary outcome was survival at 12 months. On an exploratory basis, we assessed whether the effect of lithium depended on the genotype. RESULTS: Clinical data were available for 518 of the 606 participants. Overall, treatment with lithium carbonate did not improve 12-month survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.4; p = 0.96). Both the UNC13A and C9orf72 genotype were independent predictors of survival (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3; p = 0.006 and HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.2; p = 0.032, respectively). The effect of lithium was different for UNC13A carriers (p = 0.027), but not for C9orf72 carriers (p = 0.22). The 12-month survival probability for UNC13A carriers treated with lithium carbonate improved from 40.1% (95% CI 23.2-69.1) to 69.7% (95% CI 50.4-96.3). CONCLUSIONS: This study incorporated genetic data into past ALS trials to determine treatment effects in a genetic post hoc analysis. Our results suggest that we should reorient our strategies toward finding treatments for ALS, start focusing on genotype-targeted treatments, and standardize genotyping in order to optimize randomization and analysis for future clinical trials.",

Preclinical and clinical studies seek to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of lithium in neurodegenerative disorders. The aims of this literature review is to gather clinical studies that investigated the efficacy of lithium in neurodegenerative diseases, using a systematic method based on PubMed data.

Lithium exposure showed a potential neuroprotective effect in studies on psychiatric populations with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in exposed patients. In patients with mild cognitive impairment, lithium would be associated with clinical improvement and a lower level of cerebrospinal phosphorylated tau protein. Lithium would allow at least a partial improvement in symptoms, including suicidal thoughts, in Huntington's disease. Despite several positive case reports and short studies, further controlled researches have failed to substantiate any positive effects of lithium exposure in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Midostaurin was a prototype kinase inhibitor, originally developed as a protein kinase C inhibitor and subsequently as an angiogenesis inhibitor, based on its inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. Despite promising preclinical data, early clinical trials in multiple diseases showed only modest efficacy. In 1996, the relatively frequent occurrence of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) activating mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was first recognized. Several years later, midostaurin was discovered to be a potent inhibitor of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase and to have activity against mutant forms of KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase, which drive advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM). Through a series of collaborations between industry and academia, midostaurin in combination with standard chemotherapy was evaluated in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 10603/RATIFY study, a large, phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. This was the first study to show significant improvements in overall survival and event-free survival with the addition of a targeted therapy to standard chemotherapy in this population. Around the same time, durable responses were also observed in other trials of midostaurin in patients with advanced SM. Collectively, these clinical data led to the approval of midostaurin by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for both newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML and advanced SM.",

Virtually all patients of the rare inflammatory eye disease birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR) carry the HLA-A*29:02 allele. BSCR is also associated with endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2), an enzyme involved in processing HLA class I ligands, thus implicating the A*29:02 peptidome in this disease. To investigate the relationship between both risk factors we employed label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the effects of ERAP2 on the A*29:02-bound peptidome. An ERAP2-negative cell line was transduced with lentiviral constructs containing GFP-ERAP2 or GFP alone, and the A*29:02 peptidomes from both transduced cells were compared. A similar analysis was performed with two additional A*29:02-positive, ERAP1-concordant, cell lines expressing or not ERAP2. In both comparisons the presence of ERAP2 affected the following features of the A*29:02 peptidome: 1) Length, with increased amounts of peptides >9-mers, and 2) N-terminal residues, with less ERAP2-susceptible and more hydrophobic ones. The paradoxical effects on peptide length suggest that unproductive binding to ERAP2 might protect some peptides from ERAP1 over-trimming. The influence on N-terminal residues can be explained by a direct effect of ERAP2 on trimming, without ruling out and improved processing in concert with ERAP1. The alterations in the A*29:02 peptidome suggest that the association of ERAP2 with BSCR is through its effects on peptide processing. These differ from those on the ankylosing spondylitis-associated HLA-B*27. Thus, ERAP2 alters the peptidome of distinct HLA molecules as a function of their specific binding preferences, influencing different pathological outcomes in an allele-dependent way.",

Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) that is critically involved in many biological processes that are linked to cell stress responses. It is catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In particular, PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is activated upon sensing nicked DNA. Once activated, PARP1 is responsible for the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage response mechanisms. This observation provided the rationale for developing PARP1 inhibitors for the treatment of human malignancies. Indeed, three PARP1 inhibitors (Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib) have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Moreover, in 2017, both Olaparib and Niraparib have also been approved for the treatment of fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Despite this very exciting progress in the clinic, the basic signaling mechanism that connects PARP1 to a diverse array of biological processes is still poorly understood. This is, in large part, due to the inherent technical difficulty associated with the analysis of protein PARylation, which is a low-abundance, labile, and heterogeneous PTM. The study of PARylation has been greatly facilitated by the recent advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies tailored to the analysis of this modification.

Moreover, low Gata1 expression was found to be significantly associated with the EMH. Several gene mutations were found to be associated with significant splenomegaly in MF.

Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of JAK2 inhibitor pacritinib with that of best available therapy (BAT), including ruxolitinib, in patients with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this phase 3 randomized international multicenter study-the PERSIST-2 study-of pacritinib vs BAT, 311 patients with myelofibrosis and platelet count 100 \u00d7 109/L or less were recruited for analysis. Crossover from BAT was allowed after week 24 or for progression of splenomegaly. Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to pacritinib 400 mg once daily, pacritinib 200 mg twice daily, or BAT. Main Outcomes and Measures: Coprimary end points were rates of patients achieving 35% or more spleen volume reduction (SVR) and 50% or more reduction in total symptom score (TSS) at week 24. Efficacy analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat efficacy population, comprising all patients with a randomization date allowing for week 24 data. Results: Overall, 311 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.70 [9.08] years; 171 men [55%] and 140 women [45%]) were included in the study; 149 patients (48%) had prior ruxolitinib. The most common BAT was ruxolitinib (44 patients [45%]); 19 patients (19%) received watchful-waiting only. The intention-to-treat efficacy population included 75 patients randomized to pacritinib once daily; 74, pacritinib twice daily, and 72, BAT. Pacritinib (arms combined) was more effective than BAT for 35% or more SVR (27 patients [18%] vs 2 patients [3%]; P = .001) and had a nonsignificantly greater rate of 50% or more reduction in TSS (37 patients [25%] vs 10 patients [14%]; P = .08). Pacritinib twice daily led to significant improvements in both end points over BAT ( > 35% SVR: 16 patients [22%] vs 2 patients [3%]; P = .001; > 50% reduction in TSS: 24 patients [32%] vs 10 patients [14%]; P = .01). Clinical improvement in hemoglobin and reduction in transfusion burden were greatest with pacritinib twice daily. For pacritinib once daily, pacritinib twice daily, and BAT, the most common (>10%) grade 3 or 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (32 patients [31%], 34 patients [32%], 18 patients [18%]), and anemia (28 patients [27%], 23 patients [22%], 14 patients [14%]). In the pacritinib once daily, twice daily, and BAT arms, discontinuation owing to adverse events occurred in 15 patients (14%), 10 patients (9%), and 4 patients (4%). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia, including those with prior anti-JAK therapy, pacritinib twice daily was more effective than BAT, including ruxolitinib, for reducing splenomegaly and symptoms.

          "context": "The role of JAK2 inhibitors in MPNs 7 years after approval. Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) include essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (MF). Phenotype-driver mutations of JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes are present in MPNs and can be variably combined with additional mutations. Driver mutations entail a constitutive activation of the JAK2/STAT pathway, the key signaling cascade in MPNs. Among JAK2 inhibitors (JAKis), ruxolitinib (RUX) has been approved for the treatment of intermediate and high-risk MF and for PV inadequately controlled by or intolerant of hydroxyurea. Other JAKis, such as fedratinib and pacritinib, proved to be useful in MF. The primary end points in MF trials were spleen volume response (SVR) and symptom response, whereas in PV trials they were hematocrit control with or without spleen response. In advanced MF, RUX achieved a long lasting SVR of >35% in \u223c60% of patients, establishing a new benchmark for MF treatment. RUX efficacy in early MF is also remarkable and toxicity is mild. In PV, RUX achieved hematocrit control in \u223c60% of cases and SVR in 40%. Symptom relief was evident in both conditions. In the long-term, however, many MF patients lose their SVR. Indeed, the definition of RUX failure and the design of new trials in this setting are unmet needs. Decrease of hemoglobin/platelet levels and increased infection rates are the most common side effects of RUX, and nonmelanoma skin tumors need to be monitored while on treatment. In conclusion, the introduction of JAKis raises the bar of treatment goals in MF and PV.",

The treatment landscape for myelofibrosis (MF) has reached the molecular era by targeting different pathways that are implied in this myeloproliferative neoplasm. A few years ago, the first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, demonstrated reductions in both constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly, leading to the US FDA approval. The development or worsening of cytopenias in patients receiving ruxolitinib uncovered an unmet need that has been addressed by alternative approaches. Pacritinib, a dual JAK2 and FLT3 inhibitor which also inhibits IRAK1, has demonstrated the ability to favorably impact MF-associated splenomegaly and symptom burden, while having limited myelosuppression with manageable gastrointestinal toxicity. Herein, we provide an overview of pacritinib, from early preclinical studies to the latest and ongoing PAC203 trial, as an emerging therapy for MF.",
