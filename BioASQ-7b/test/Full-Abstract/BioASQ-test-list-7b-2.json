Next-generation sequencing has been invaluable in the elucidation of the genetic etiology of many subtypes of intellectual disability in recent years. Here, using exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we identified three de novo truncating mutations in WAS protein family member 1 (WASF1) in five unrelated individuals with moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic features and seizures. WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C>T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C>T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23). All three variants are predicted to partially or fully disrupt the C-terminal actin-binding WCA domain. Functional studies using fibroblast cells from two affected individuals with the c.1516C>T mutation showed a truncated WASF1 and a defect in actin remodeling. This study provides evidence that de\u00a0novo heterozygous mutations in WASF1 cause a rare form of intellectual disability.",

BACKGROUND: In April 2015, Kamwenge District, western Uganda reported a measles outbreak. We investigated the outbreak to identify potential exposures that facilitated measles transmission, assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) and vaccination coverage (VC), and recommend prevention and control measures. METHODS: For this investigation, a probable case was defined as onset of fever and generalized maculopapular rash, plus > 1 of the following symptoms: Coryza, conjunctivitis, or cough. A confirmed case was defined as a probable case plus identification of measles-specific IgM in serum. For case-finding, we reviewed patients' medical records and conducted in-home patient examination. In a case-control study, we compared exposures of case-patients and controls matched by age and village of residence. For children aged 9\u00a0m-5y, we estimated VC using the percent of children among the controls who had been vaccinated against measles, and calculated VE using the formula, VE = 1 - OR, where OR was the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio associated with having a measles vaccination history. RESULTS: We identified 213 probable cases with onset between April and August, 2015. Of 23 blood specimens collected, 78% were positive for measles-specific IgM. Measles attack rate was highest in the youngest age-group, 0-5y (13/10,000), and decreased as age increased. The epidemic curve indicated sustained propagation in the community. Of the 50 case-patients and 200 controls, 42% of case-patients and 12% of controls visited health centers during their likely exposure period (OR = 6.1; 95% CI = 2.7-14). Among children aged 9\u00a0m-5y, VE was estimated at 70% (95% CI: 24-88%), and VC at 75% (95% CI: 67-83%). Excessive crowding was observed at all health centers; no patient triage-system existed. CONCLUSIONS: The spread of measles during this outbreak was facilitated by patient mixing at crowded health centers, suboptimal VE and inadequate VC. We recommended emergency immunization campaign targeting children <5y in the affected sub-counties, as well as triaging and isolation of febrile or rash patients visiting health centers.",

Proteases known as sheddases cleave the extracellular domains of their substrates from the cell surface. The A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 are among the most prominent sheddases, being widely expressed in many tissues, frequently overexpressed in cancer, and promiscuously cleaving diverse substrates. It is increasingly clear that the proteolytic shedding of transmembrane receptors impacts pathophysiology and drug response. Receptor substrates of sheddases include the cytokine receptors TNFR1 and IL6R; the Notch receptors; type-I and -III TGF\u03b2 receptors; receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as HER2, HER4, and VEGFR2; and, in particular, MET and TAM-family RTKs AXL and Mer (MerTK). Activation of receptor shedding by mechanical cues, hypoxia, radiation, and phosphosignaling offers insight into mechanisms of drug resistance. This particularly holds for kinase inhibitors targeting BRAF (such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and MEK (such as trametinib and cobimetinib), along with direct sheddase inhibitors. Receptor proteolysis can be detected in patient fluids and is especially relevant in melanoma, glioblastoma, lung cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer where RTK substrates, MAPK signaling, and ADAMs are frequently dysregulated. Translatable strategies to exploit receptor shedding include combination kinase inhibitor regimens, recombinant decoy receptors based on endogenous counterparts, and, potentially, immunotherapy.

Deregulation of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has recently been demonstrated to predominately promote survival and chemoresistance of cancer cells. Intramembrane proteolysis mediated by presenilin/\u03b3-secretase is known to regulate the homeostasis of some RTKs. In the present study, we demonstrate that AXL, but not TYRO3 or MERTK, is efficiently and sequentially cleaved by \u03b1- and \u03b3-secretases in various types of cancer cell lines. Proteolytic processing of AXL redirected signaling toward a secretase-mediated pathway, away from the classic, well-known, ligand-dependent canonical RTK signaling pathway. The AXL intracellular domain cleavage product, but not full-length AXL, was further shown to translocate into the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence that harbored a basic HRRKK motif. Of interest, we found that the \u03b3-secretase-uncleavable AXL mutant caused an elevated chemoresistance in non-small-cell lung cancer cells. Altogether, our findings suggest that AXL can undergo sequential processing mediated by various proteases kept in a homeostatic balance. This newly discovered post-translational processing of AXL may provide an explanation for the diverse functions of AXL, especially in the context of drug resistance in cancer cells.-Lu, Y., Wan, J., Yang, Z., Lei, X., Niu, Q., Jiang, L., Passtoors, W.

For most RTKs, however, it is unknown whether they can exploit this new signaling mechanism. Here we used a system-wide screen to address the frequency of susceptibility to gamma-secretase cleavage among human RTKs. The screen covering 45 of the 55 human RTKs identified 12 new as well as all nine previously published gamma-secretase substrates. We biochemically validated the screen by demonstrating that the release of a soluble intracellular fragment from endogenous AXL was dependent on the sheddase disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) and the gamma-secretase component presenilin-1. Functional analysis of the cleavable RTKs indicated that proliferation promoted by overexpression of the TAM family members AXL or TYRO3 depends on gamma-secretase cleavage. Taken together, these data indicate that gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage provides an additional signaling mechanism for numerous human RTKs.",

BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia is the collective name for different types of leukemias of myeloid origin affecting blood and bone marrow. The overproduction of immature myeloblasts (white blood cells) is the characteristic feature of AML, thus flooding the bone marrow and reducing its capacity to produce normal blood cells. USFDA on August 1, 2017, approved a drug named Enasidenib formerly known as AG-221 which is being marketed under the name Idhifa to treat R/R AML with IDH2 mutation. The present review depicts the broad profile of enasidenib including various aspects of chemistry, preclinical, clinical studies, pharmacokinetics, mode of action and toxicity studies. METHODS: Various reports and research articles have been referred to summarize different aspects related to chemistry and pharmacokinetics of enasidenib. Clinical data was collected from various recently published clinical reports including clinical trial outcomes. RESULT: The various findings of enasidenib revealed that it has been designed to allosterically inhibit mutated IDH2 to treat R/R AML patients. It has also presented good safety and efficacy profile along with 9.3 months overall survival rates of patients in which disease has relapsed. The drug is still under study either in combination or solely to treat hematological malignancies. Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket. Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and calcium levels, etc. Conclusion: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies. Hence, it may come in the light as a potent lead entity for anticancer treatment in the coming years.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein in the epithelial membrane, and affects at least 30,000 people in the USA.

In July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), a combination drug that works on reversing the effects of the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. Orkambi and mucolytics decrease the viscosity of mucous secretions, leading to an accumulation of hypoviscous fluid in the alveoli, resulting in dyspnea. This presentation can be mistaken for an infective exacerbation. We present a case in which a young female with CF recently started on Orkambi therapy presented to her primary care physician with dyspnea and increased respiratory secretions and was admitted to the hospital for 2 weeks of intravenous and inhaled antibiotic therapy for a presumed CF exacerbation. We highlight this case to bring awareness and educate patients and clinicians of the side-effect profile of Orkambi therapy with an intent to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations, inpatient antibiotics, and other costly medical services.",

Although ivacaftor (VX-770) alone and ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor (VX-809) improve lung function in CF patients with the Gly551Asp and del508Phe mutations, respectively, the effects of these drugs on the function of human CF macrophages are unknown.

Lumacaftor alone restored the ability of CF MDMs to phagocytose and kill P. aeruginosa to levels observed in MDMs obtained from non-CF (WT-CFTR) donors. This effect contrasts with the partial (~15%) correction of del508Phe Cl secretion of airway epithelial cells by lumacaftor. Ivacaftor reduced the ability of lumacaftor to stimulate phagocytosis and killing of P. aeruginosa. Lumacaftor had no effect on P. aeruginosa-stimulated cytokine secretion by CF MDMs. Ivacaftor (5 \u00b5M) alone and ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor reduced secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-shortening genetic disease affecting ~1 in 3,500 of the Caucasian population. CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. To date, more than 2,000 CFTR mutations have been identified, which produce a wide range of phenotypes. The CFTR protein, a chloride channel, is normally expressed on epithelial cells lining the lung, gut, and exocrine glands. Mutations in CFTR have led to pleiotropic effects in CF patients and have resulted in early morbidity and mortality. Research has focused on identifying small molecules, or modulators, that can restore CFTR function. In recent years, two modulators, ivacaftor (Kalydeco) and lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi), have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat CF patients with certain CFTR mutations. The development of these modulators has served as proof-of-concept that targeting CFTR by modulators is a viable therapeutic option. Efforts to discover new modulators that could deliver a wider and greater clinical benefit are still ongoing. However, traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) require large numbers of patients and become impracticable to test the modulators' efficacy in CF patients with CFTR mutations at frequencies much lower than 1%, suggesting the need for personalized medicine in these CF patients.",

Deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the most common cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing mutation. Recently, ORKAMBI, a combination therapy that includes a corrector of the processing defect of F508del-CFTR (lumacaftor or VX-809) and a potentiator of channel activity (ivacaftor or VX-770), was approved for CF patients homozygous for this mutation. However, clinical studies revealed that the effect of ORKAMBI on lung function is modest and it was proposed that this modest effect relates to a negative impact of VX-770 on the stability of F508del-CFTR. In the current studies, we showed that this negative effect of VX-770 at 10 \u03bcM correlated with its inhibitory effect on VX-809-mediated correction of the interface between the second membrane spanning domain and the first nucleotide binding domain bearing F508del. Interestingly, we found that VX-770 exerted a similar negative effect on the stability of other membrane localized solute carriers (SLC26A3, SLC26A9, and SLC6A14), suggesting that this negative effect is not specific for F508del-CFTR. We determined that the relative destabilizing effect of a panel of VX-770 derivatives on F508del-CFTR correlated with their predicted lipophilicity. Polarized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy on a supported lipid bilayer model shows that VX-770, and not its less lipophilic derivative, increased the fluidity of and reorganized the membrane. In summary, our findings show that there is a potential for nonspecific effects of VX-770 on the lipid bilayer and suggest that this effect may account for its destabilizing effect on VX-809- rescued F508del-CFTR.",

In eukaryotes, mRNA export involves many evolutionarily conserved factors that carry the nascent transcript to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The THO/TREX complex couples transcription to mRNA export and recruits the mRNA export receptor NXF1 for the transport of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNP) to the NPC. The transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) was suggested to interact with NXF1 and to shuttle between transcription sites and the NPC. Here, we characterize the dynamics of human TREX-2 and show that it stably associates with the NPC basket. Moreover, the association of TREX-2 with the NPC requires the basket nucleoporins NUP153 and TPR, but is independent of transcription. Differential profiles of mRNA nuclear accumulation reveal that TREX-2 functions similarly to basket nucleoporins, but differently from NXF1. Thus, our results show that TREX-2 is an NPC-associated complex in mammalian cells and suggest that it is involved in putative NPC basket-related functions.",

Nup153 is a peripheral NPC component that has been implicated in protein and RNP transport and in the interaction of NPCs with the nuclear lamina. Here, Nup153 is localized by immunogold electron microscopy to a position on the nuclear ring of the NPC. Nuclear reconstitution is used to investigate the role of Nup153 in nucleo- cytoplasmic transport and NPC architecture. NPCs assembled in the absence of Nup153 lacked several nuclear basket components, were unevenly distributed in the NE and, unlike wild-type NPCs, were mobile within the NE. Importin alpha/beta-mediated protein import into the nucleus was strongly reduced in the absence of Nup153, while transportin-mediated import was unaffected. This was due to a reduction in import complex translocation rather than to defective receptor recycling. Our results therefore reveal functions for Nup153 in NPC assembly, in anchoring NPCs within the NE and in mediating specific nuclear import events.",

In esc1Delta cells, Ulp1 and nuclear basket components Nup60 and Mlp1 no longer distribute broadly around the nuclear periphery, but co-localize in a small number of dense-staining perinuclear foci. Loss of Esc1 (or Nup60) alters SUMO conjugate accumulation and enhances ulp1 mutant defects. Similar to previous findings with Mlp1, both Esc1 and Ulp1 help retain unspliced pre-mRNAs in the nucleus.

When lamina assembly is prevented using the dominant-negative mutant XlaminB delta 2+, Nup153 does not appear at the nuclear envelope, while other F/GXFG-containing nucleoporins and Nup93 are recruited normally. When the lamina of pre-assembled nuclei is disrupted using the same dominant-negative mutant, the distribution of other nucleoporins is unaffected.

The median percentage increase in urinary aldosterone to creatinine ratio (UAldo : C) between day 0 and day 30 was significantly lower in the S/V group (12%; P = .032) as compared with the placebo group (195%). The median percentage decrease of NT-proBNP concentration from day 0 to day 30 was not statistically different between groups (P = .68). No statistical differences were seen in echocardiographic, thoracic radiographic, SAP, or serum biochemical test results measured at any time point between groups. No adverse events were observed for dogs in either group. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Sacubitril/valsartan may provide a new pharmaceutical method to effectively inhibit the RAAS in dogs with ACVIM Stage B2 MMVD.",

AIMS: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a highly prevalent co-morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and can play a detrimental role in the pathophysiology course of CHF. However, the best way to manage SDB in CHF remains a matter of debate. Sacubitril-valsartan has been included in the 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines as an alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to further reduce the risk of progression of CHF, CHF hospitalization, and death in ambulatory patients. Sacubitril and valsartan are good candidates for correcting SDB of CHF patients because their known mechanisms of action are likely to counteract the pathophysiology of SDB in CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ENTRESTO-SAS trial is a 3-month, multicentric, prospective, open-label real-life cohort study. Patients eligible for sacubitril-valsartan treatment (i.e. adults with left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) will be evaluated before and after 3\u00a0months of treatment (nocturnal ventilatory polygraphy, echocardiography, laboratory testing, and quality-of-life and SDB questionnaires). The primary outcome is the change in the Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index, before and after 3\u00a0months of treatment. One hundred twenty patients are required to detect a significant 20% improvement of the Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index with a power of 90% at an alpha risk of 5%. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the SERVE-HF study, physicians are waiting for new trials and alternative therapies. We sought to assess in the ENTRESTO-SAS trial whether sacubitril-valsartan could improve the outcome of SDB in CHF patients.",

Many drugs are approved and used in practice for management of this condition; including beta blockers, diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI's), and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs). Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug with brand name Entresto (Sacubitril/Valsartan or LCZ696), an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor for the use in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) patients instead of ACEI's and ARBs. The drug works through angiotensin receptor blockage via valsartan as well as neprilysin inhibition with sacubitril. This represented a new milestone in managing heart failure patients and provided yet another therapy in our armamentarium. This article reviews the stages that led to the development of this drug, the failure of its preceding agents, the lessons we have learnt, and the current trials of Entresto for new indications.",

A novel antihypertensive drug, LCZ696 (Entresto\u00ae), has recently been introduced, which combines the action of an antagonist of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), effectively decreasing the blood pressure, with an inhibition of neprilysin, which is responsible for metabolizing natriuretic peptides exerting antihypertensive and antifibrotic effects. In this MiniReview, we describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, efficacy and side effects of the combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696. We summarize the effect of LCZ696 treatment of patients suffering from hypertension and heart failure (HF) and further highlight the role of this new drug as a treatment option in the future. In the earlier stages of the treatment of patients with heart failure, LCZ696 was superior in lowering the blood pressure compared to olmesartan, while the effect on blood pressure at long-term treatment was comparable for the two drugs. The numbers of adverse effects were comparable. LCZ696 was superior to enalapril in reducing mortality, hospitalizations and HF symptoms. Adverse effects were reduced with a slower up-titrating regimen of 6 weeks. The current results are promising and suggest that LCZ696 will be a new candidate for first-line treatment of HF. However, it needs to be explored whether LCZ696 is safe in pregnant women, what are the effects of long-term LCZ696 treatment on survival and whether the antifibrotic effects can be of major benefit in, for example HF with preserved ejection fraction.",

The costimulatory molecule CD40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and is expressed on various antigen presenting cells (APCs) as well as some tumor cells. The binding to the natural ligand CD40L, which is expressed on T helper cells, leads to APC activation and thus enhancement of immune responses. Treatment with anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies has been exploited in several cancer immunotherapy studies in mice and led to the development of anti-CD40 antibodies for clinical use. Here, Dacetuzumab and Lucatumumab are in the most advanced stage and are being tested as treatment for malignancies such as chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), Multiple Myeloma (MM), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The promising results from these early clinical trials have encouraged clinical drug development in order to investigate the effect of CD40 mAbs in combination with other cancer immunotherapies, in particular interleukin (IL)-2. An in-depth analysis of this immunotherapy is provided elsewhere. In the present review, we provide an update of the most recent clinical trials with anti-CD40 antibodies.

MOTIVATION: The NanoString nCounter Platform is a new and promising technology for measuring nucleic acid abundances. It has several advantages over PCR-based techniques, including avoidance of amplification, direct sequence interrogation and digital detection for absolute quantification. These features minimize aspects of experimental error and hold promise for dealing with challenging experimental conditions such as archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. However, systematic inter-sample technical artifacts caused by variability in sample preservation, bio-molecular extraction and platform fluctuations must be removed to ensure robust data. RESULTS: To facilitate this process and to address these issues for NanoString datasets, we have written a pre-processing package called NanoStringNorm in the R statistical language. Key features include an extensible environment for method comparison and new algorithm development, integrated gene and sample diagnostics, and facilitated downstream statistical analysis. The package is open-source, is available through the CRAN package repository, includes unit-tests to ensure numerical accuracy, and provides visual and numeric diagnostics.

The inflammatory diseases that are most strongly associated with major histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) alleles are also influenced by endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP) 1 and/or 2, often in epistasis with the susceptibility MHC-I allele. This review will focus on the four major MHC-I-associated inflammatory disorders: ankylosing spondylitis, birdshot chorioretinopathy, Beh\u00e7et's disease and psoriasis. The genetics of ERAP1/ERAP2 association and the alterations induced by polymorphism of these enzymes on the risk MHC-I allotypes will be examined. A pattern emerges of analogous effects on peptide length, sequence and affinity of disparate peptidomes, suggesting that similar peptide-mediated mechanisms underlie the pathogenesis and the joint contribution of ERAP1/ERAP2 and MHC-I to distinct inflammatory diseases. Processing of specific antigens, peptide-dependent changes in global properties of the MHC-I molecules, such as folding and stability, or both may be pathogenic.",

Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a rare ocular inflammation whose genetic association with HLA-A*29:02 is the highest between a disease and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. It belongs to a group of MHC-I-associated inflammatory disorders, also including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and Beh\u00e7et's disease, for which endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases (ERAP) 1 and/or 2 have been identified as genetic risk factors. Since both enzymes are involved in the processing of MHC-I ligands, it seems reasonable that common peptide-mediated mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of these diseases. In this study, comparative immunopeptidomics was used to characterize >5000 A*29:02 ligands and quantify the effects of ERAP1 polymorphism and expression on the A*29:02 peptidome in human cells. The peptides predominant in an active ERAP1 context showed a higher frequency of nonamers and bulkier amino acid side chains at multiple positions, compared with the peptides predominant in a less active ERAP1 background. Thus, ERAP1 polymorphism has a large influence, shaping the A*29:02 peptidome through length-dependent and length-independent effects. These changes resulted in increased affinity and hydrophobicity of A*29:02 ligands in an active ERAP1 context. The results reveal the nature of the functional interaction between A*29:02 and ERAP1 and suggest that this enzyme may affect the susceptibility to birdshot chorioretinopathy by altering the A*29:02 peptidome. The complexity of these alterations is such that not only peptide presentation but also other potentially pathogenic features could be affected.",
