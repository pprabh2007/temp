          "context": "Association of genetic variants of xenobiotic metabolic pathway with systemic lupus erythematosus. In view of documented evidence that catechol estrogen-DNA adducts serve as epitopes for binding of anti-nuclear antibodies, genetic polymorphisms of the xenobiotic metabolic pathway involved in estrogen metabolism might contribute towards pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To test this hypothesis, a case-control study was conducted. Cytochrome P 450 1A1 (CYP1A1) m4 (OR: 4.93, 95% CI: 1.31-18.49), catecholamine-o-methyl transferase (COMT) H108L (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.03-1.88) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) T1 null (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.11- 3.01) variants showed association with SLE risk. SHEsis web-based platform analysis showed mild to moderate linkage disequilibrium between the CYP1A1 ml, m2 and m4 variants (D': 0.19-0.37). Among the different haplotypes of CYP1A1, CAC-haplotype harboring CYP1A1 ml variant showed association with SLE risk (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.11-1.92). Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis (MDR) showed potential gene-gene interactions between the phase II variants i.e. COMT H108L x GSTT1 null x GSTM1 null (p < 0.0001) and also between the phase II and I variants i.e. COMT H108L x GSTTI null x CYP1A1 ml x CYP1A1 m2 in inflating the risk of SLE by 3.33-folds (95% CI: 2.30-4.82) and 4.00-folds (95% CI: 2.77-5.78), respectively. To conclude, hyperinducibility of CYP1A1 due to ml and m4 variants and defective phase-II detoxification due to COMT H108L and GSTT1 null variants increase the susceptibility to SLE.",

Experimental and animal studies suggested that estrogens play an important role in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through a variety of mechanisms involved in the regulation of the immune system. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variations in estrogen metabolic pathway genes, including estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), estrogen receptor beta (ESR2), and aromatase (CYP19A1), and risk of SLE. We performed a genetic study of SLE among 46 medical record-confirmed female SLE cases and 102 female controls participating in an Internet-based case-control study of SLE. Polymorphisms analysed included: ESR1 PvuII, XbaI, and GT repeat; ESR2 RsaI, AluI, and CA repeat; and CYP19A1 RsaI, SfaN1, and TTTA repeat. We found significant association of the ESR1 PvuII (PP vs. pp, odds ratio (OR): 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-9.3) and XbaI (XX vs. xx, adjusted OR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.1-10.5) with SLE. Carrying the PPXX genotype conferred the highest risk (PPXX vs. ppxx, OR: 4.6, 95% CI: 1.3-15.9). We also found an association of SLE with the ESR2 CA repeat (SS vs. LL, OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.0-8.0). Our results support a role of estrogen in pathogenesis of SLE and suggested that genetic variants in the estrogen receptor genes might influence susceptibility.",

PCR-RFLP/AFLP, bisulfite-sequencing and real-time PCR approaches were used for genetic, epigenetic and expression analysis respectively. SLE cases exhibited elevated plasma homocysteine levels compared to healthy controls (24.93 \u00b1 1.3 vs. 11.67 \u00b1 0.48 \u03bcmol/l), while plasma folate levels showed no association (7.10 \u00b1 2.49 vs. 7.64 \u00b1 2.09 ng/ml).

The hypermethylation of RFC1 as observed in the current study may contribute for its down regulation. Plasma folate and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat showed an inverse association with methylation of RFC1 and MHC2TA. SLE cases with hypocomplementemia showed hypermethylation of RFC1, hypomethylation/up regulation of MHC2TA and down regulation of HLA-DR. The hypermethylation of MHC2TA and down regulation of RFC1, MHC2TA and HLA-DR were observed in anti-cardiolipin antibody positive SLE cases. The up regulation of RFC1 and HLA-DR was observed in anti-dsDNA antibody positive SLE cases. The hypomethylation/upregulation of RFC1 and MHC2TA was observed in anti-RNP antibody positive cases. To conclude, one-carbon genetic variants influence epigenetic of MHC2TA and RFC1, thus contributing to phenotypic heterogeneity of SLE.",

Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease caused, in part, by abnormalities in cells of the immune system including B and T cells. Genetically reducing globally the expression of the ETS transcription factor FLI1 by 50% in two lupus mouse models significantly improves disease measures and survival through an unknown mechanism. In this study we analyze the effects of reducing FLI1 in the MRL/lpr lupus prone model on T cell function. We demonstrate that adoptive transfer of MRL/lpr Fli1(+/+) or Fli1(+/-) T cells and B cells into Rag1-deficient mice results in significantly decreased serum immunoglobulin levels in animals receiving Fli1(+/-) lupus T cells compared to animals receiving Fli1(+/+) lupus T cells regardless of the genotype of co-transferred lupus B cells. Ex vivo analyses of MRL/lpr T cells demonstrated that Fli1(+/-) T cells produce significantly less IL-4 during early and late disease and exhibited significantly decreased TCR-specific activation during early disease compared to Fli1(+/+) T cells. Moreover, the Fli1(+/-) T cells expressed significantly less neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) message and decreased NEU activity during early disease and significantly decreased levels of glycosphingolipids during late disease compared to Fli1(+/+) T cells. FLI1 dose-dependently activated the Neu1 promoter in mouse and human T cell lines. Together, our results suggest reducing FLI1 in lupus decreases the pathogenicity of T cells by decreasing TCR-specific activation and IL-4 production in part through the modulation of glycosphingolipid metabolism. Reducing the expression of FLI1 or targeting the glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway in lupus may serve as a therapeutic approach to treating lupus.",

Among participants in the Clinical Phenotyping and Resource Biobank (C-PROBE) study and the Seattle Kidney Study (SKS), we tested whether kidney tissue expression of  mRNA correlates with circulating levels of GDF-15 and whether elevations in circulating GDF-15 are associated with decline in kidney function. In matching samples of 24 patients with CKD from the C-PROBE study, circulating GDF-15 levels significantly correlated with intrarenal  transcript levels (=0.54, =0.01).

BACKGROUND: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is expressed and secreted in response to inflammation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, telomere erosion, and oncogene activation. Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major driver of GDF-15 production. GDF-15 has favorable preanalytic characteristics and can be measured in serum and plasma by immunoassay. CONTENT: In community-dwelling individuals higher concentrations of GDF-15 are associated with increased risks of developing CV disease, chronic kidney disease, and cancer, independent of traditional CV risk factors, renal function, and other biomarkers (C-reactive protein, B-type natriuretic peptide, cardiac troponin). Low concentrations of GDF-15 are closely associated with longevity. GDF-15 is as an independent marker of all-cause mortality and CV events in patients with coronary artery disease, and may help select patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome for early revascularization and more intensive medical therapies. GDF-15 is independently associated with mortality and nonfatal events in atrial fibrillation and heart failure (HF) with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. GDF-15 reflects chronic disease burden and acute perturbations in HF and responds to improvements in hemodynamic status. GDF-15 is independently associated with major bleeding in patients receiving antithrombotic therapies and has been included in a new bleeding risk score, which may become useful for decision support. SUMMARY: GDF-15 captures distinct aspects of CV disease development, progression, and prognosis, which are not represented by clinical risk predictors and other biomarkers. The usefulness of GDF-15 to guide management decisions and discover new treatment targets should be further explored.",

BACKGROUND: The cancer-anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS) negatively affects survival and therapy success in cancer patients. Inflammatory mediators and tumour-derived factors are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of CACS. However, the central and peripheral mechanisms contributing to CACS are insufficiently understood. The area postrema (AP) and the nucleus tractus solitarii are two important brainstem centres for the control of eating during acute sickness conditions. Recently, the tumour-derived macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) emerged as a possible mediator of cancer anorexia because lesions of these brainstem areas attenuated the anorectic effect of exogenous MIC-1 in mice. METHODS: Using a rat hepatoma tumour model, we examined the roles of the AP and of vagal afferents in the mediation of CACS. Specifically, we investigated whether a lesion of the AP (APX) or subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) attenuate anorexia, body weight, muscle, and fat loss. Moreover, we analysed MIC-1 levels in this tumour model and their correlation with tumour size and the severity of the anorectic response. RESULTS: In tumour-bearing sham-operated animals mean daily food intake significantly decreased. The anorectic response was paralleled by a significant loss of body weight and muscle mass. APX rats were protected against anorexia, body weight loss, and muscle atrophy after tumour induction. In contrast, subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation did not attenuate cancer-induced anorexia or body weight loss. Tumour-bearing rats had substantially increased MIC-1 levels, which positively correlated with tumour size and cancer progression and negatively correlated with food intake. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the importance of the AP in the mediation of cancer-dependent anorexia and body weight loss and support a pathological role of MIC-1 as a tumour-derived factor mediating CACS, possibly via an AP-dependent action.",

An adjustment of sex ratio of offspring to the conditions present at conception is seen in many mammals including horses.

We hypothesized that sex-related differences in IGF-1 expression in equine embryos during the phase of maternal recognition of pregnancy might exist and thus contribute to preferential survival of embryos from either of both sexes under specific environmental conditions. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression of in\u00a0vivo-produced equine embryos on different days of pregnancy (Day 8, N = 6; Day 10, N = 8; Day 12, N = 14) was analyzed.

The sex of the embryo was determined by detection of X-inactivation specific transcript (Xist) RNA and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome DNA. Embryos positive for Xist expression were classified as female, and Xist negative and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome positive embryos were classified as male. From 28 embryos tested, 15 (54%) showed positive Xist expression and were thus classified as female.

We now report the presence of Xist/XIST transcripts in newborn and adult mouse testes, and in human testicular tissue with normal spermatogenesis, but not in the testes of patients who lack germ cells. Our results indicate that while the X chromosome in males is active in somatic cells, it undergoes inactivation during spermatogenesis.",

Preattachment embryos at different times after ovulation (Day 8: n = 9; Day 10: n = 12; Day 12: n = 15) were analyzed for Xist RNA expression using quantitative and qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Female and male primary equine dermal cell cultures were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Embryos tested negative for Xist were evaluated for expression of the male-specific eSRY gene by qualitative PCR at the DNA level. From 36 embryos assessed by qualitative RT-PCR, 18 showed positive Xist expression (50%). From 29 embryos tested by quantitative RT-PCR, 16 showed positive Xist expression (55%). All of the Xist-negative equine embryos tested by quantitative PCR were positive for eSRY. We also demonstrated by strand-specific RT-PCR that in the horse, as in humans, the counter transcript Tsix seems to be truncated not reaching Exon 1. In contrast to many other species, neither Xist nor Tsix was expressed in equine male testicular tissue. The results demonstrate that expression of Xist is restricted to female equine embryos. Xist can thus be considered an X-inactivation-specific marker which can be used in concert with Y-specific markers for sex determination.",

Xist transcripts were detected as a faint amplicon at the 8-cell stage initially, and consistently thereafter in all stages examined up to and including the expanded blastocyst stage. Xist transcripts, however, were subsequently detected from the 2-cell stage onward after nested RT-PCR. Preferential [3H]thymidine labeling indicative of late replication of one of the X chromosomes was noted in female embryos of different developmental ages as follows: 2 of 7 (28.5%) early blastocysts, 6 of 13 (46.1%) blastocysts, 8 of 11 (72.1%) expanded blastocysts, and 14 of 17 (77.7%) hatched blastocysts.

AIM: We hypothesized that patients with Klinefelter's syndrome (KS) not only undergo X inactivation, but also that genes escape from inactivation. Their transcripts would constitute a significant difference, as male metabolism is not adapted to a 'female-like' gene dosage. We evaluated the expression of selected X-linked genes in our 41, XX(Y)* male mice to determine whether these genes escape inactivation and whether tissue-specific differences occur. METHODS: Correct X inactivation was identified by Xist expression. Relative expression of X-linked genes was examined in liver, kidney and brain tissue by real-time PCR in adult XX(Y)* and XY* males and XX females. RESULTS: Expression of genes known to escape X inactivation was analysed. Relative mRNA levels of Pgk1 (control, X inactivated), and the genes Eif2s3x, Kdm5c, Ddx3x and Kdm6a escaping from X inactivation were quantified from liver, kidney and brain. Pgk1 mRNA expression showed no difference, confirming correct X inactivation. In kidney and liver, XX(Y)* males resembled the female expression pattern in all four candidate genes and were distinguishable from XY* males. Contrastingly, in brain tissue XX(Y)* males expressed all four genes higher than male and female controls.

Most were SDE in a single tissue. Surprisingly, nearly half of the probesets that were (SDE) in multiple tissues were oppositely sex biased in different tissues, and most SDE probesets were also expressed without sex bias in other tissues. Two genes were widely SDE: Xist (female-only) and Eif2s3y (male-only).

WHIM syndrome is a rare congenital immunodeficiency disease, named after its main clinical manifestations: warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis, which refers to abnormal accumulation of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow. The disease is primarily caused by C-terminal truncation mutations of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, giving these CXCR4-WHIM mutants a gain of function in response to their ligand CXCL12. Considering the broad functions of CXCR4 in maintaining leukocyte homeostasis, patients are panleukopenic and display altered immune responses, likely as a consequence of impairment in the differentiation and trafficking of leukocytes. Treatment of WHIM patients currently consists of symptom relief, leading to unsatisfactory clinical responses. As an alternative and potentially more effective approach, we tested the potency and efficacy of CXCR4-specific nanobodies on inhibiting CXCR4-WHIM mutants. Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins based on the smallest functional fragments of heavy chain antibodies. They combine the advantages of small-molecule drugs and antibody-based therapeutics due to their relative small size, high stability, and high affinity. We compared the potential of monovalent and bivalent CXCR4-specific nanobodies to inhibit CXCL12-induced CXCR4-WHIM-mediated signaling with the small-molecule clinical candidate AMD3100. The CXCR4-targeting nanobodies displace CXCL12 binding and bind CXCR4-wild type and CXCR4-WHIM (R334X/S338X) mutants and with (sub-) nanomolar affinities. The nanobodies' epitope was mapped to extracellular loop 2 of CXCR4, overlapping with the binding site of CXCL12. Monovalent, and in particular bivalent, nanobodies were more potent than AMD3100 in reducing CXCL12-mediated G protein activation. In addition, CXCR4-WHIM-dependent calcium flux and wound healing of human papillomavirus-immortalized cell lines in response to CXCL12 was effectively inhibited by the nanobodies. Based on these in vitro results, we conclude that CXCR4 nanobodies hold significant potential as alternative therapeutics for CXCR4-associated diseases such as WHIM syndrome.",

Warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by neutropenia, lymphopenia, susceptibility to infections, and myelokathexis, which describes degenerative changes of mature neutrophils and hyperplasia of bone marrow myeloid cells. Some patients present with hypogammaglobulinemia and/or refractory warts of skin and genitalia. Congenital cardiac defects constitute uncommon manifestations of the disease. The disorder, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, is caused by heterozygous mutations of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. These mutations lead to an increased sensitivity of neutrophils and lymphocytes to the unique ligand CXCL12 and to an increased accumulation of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow. Despite greatly improved knowledge of the disease, therapeutic choices are insufficient to prevent some of the disease outcomes, such as development of bronchiectasis, anogenital dysplasia, or invasive cancer. The available therapeutic measures aimed at preventing the risk for infection in WHIM patients are discussed. We critically evaluate the diagnostic criteria of WHIM syndrome, particularly when WHIM syndrome should be suspected in patients with congenital neutropenia and lymphopenia despite the absence of hypogammaglobulinemia and/or warts.

WHIM patient adaptive immunity defects remain largely unexplained. We have previously shown that WHIM-mutant T cells form unstable immunological synapses, affecting T cell activation. Here, we show that, in WHIM patients and WHIM CXCR4 knock-in mice, B cells are more apoptosis prone. Intriguingly, WHIM-mutant B cells were also characterized by spontaneous activation. Searching for a mechanistic explanation for these observations, we uncovered a novel costimulatory effect of CXCL12, the CXCR4 ligand, on WHIM-mutant but not wild-type B cells. The WHIM CXCR4-mediated costimulation led to increased B-cell activation, possibly involving mTOR, albeit without concurrently promoting survival. A reduction in antigenic load during immunization in the mouse was able to circumvent the adaptive immunity defects.

Myelokathexis refers to the retention of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow (BM), which accounts for degenerative changes and hypersegmentation.

The use of high-throughput technology allows us to obtain visual and quantitative data on a large number of samples quickly and easily. Not only is this an invaluable tool for conducting large-scale RNAi or compound screenings, but also allows rapid validation of candidates of interest. Here, we describe how we use the Widefield High-Content Analysis Systems to characterize the phenotypes of cells following modulation by potential regulators of Oncogene-Induced Senescence (OIS) by measuring numerous markers of senescence, including the SASP. This approach can be also used to screen for siRNA able to perturb the expression of SASP components during OIS.",

This is characterized by the secretion of proinflammatory and mitogenic cytokines, reminiscent of an SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype). Conditioned media from senescent MPM (malignant pleural mesothelioma) cells trigger the emergence of EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal)-like, clonogenic and chemoresistant cell subpopulations, expressing high levels of ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase) activity (ALDH(bright) cells). We show by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of purified ALDH(bright) and ALDH(low) cells, that both cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms converge to maintain the SASP-induced, EMT-like cell subpopulations. Chemoresistant ALDH(bright) cells exist within primary MPM specimens and enrichment for ALDH(bright) cells correlates with an earlier tumor onset into NOD/SCID mice. We show that RAS(v12) expression induces SASP-like changes in untransformed human mesothelial cells, and that p53 ablation increases the effect of RAS(v12) expression. We identify STAT3 activation as a crucial event downstream to SASP signaling. In fact, small hairpin RNA-mediated ablation of STAT3 deeply attenuates the induction of EMT genes and the increase of ALDH(bright) cells induced by SASP-cytokines. This strongly affects the chemoresistance of MPM cells in vitro and leads to anticancer effects in vivo.",

BACKGROUND: Early-life exposure to household pets has the capacity to reduce risk for overweight and allergic disease, especially following caesarean delivery. Since there is some evidence that pets also alter the gut microbial composition of infants, changes to the gut microbiome are putative pathways by which pet exposure can reduce these risks to health. To investigate the impact of pre- and postnatal pet exposure on infant gut microbiota following various birth scenarios, this study employed a large subsample of 746 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development Study (CHILD) cohort, whose mothers were enrolled during pregnancy between 2009 and 2012. Participating mothers were asked to report on household pet ownership at recruitment during the second or third trimester and 3\u00a0months postpartum. Infant gut microbiota were profiled with 16S rRNA sequencing from faecal samples collected at the mean age of 3.3\u00a0months. Two categories of pet exposure (i) only during pregnancy and (ii) pre- and postnatally were compared to no pet exposure under different birth scenarios. RESULTS: Over half of studied infants were exposed to at least one furry pet in the prenatal and/or postnatal periods, of which 8% were exposed in pregnancy alone and 46.8% had exposure during both time periods. As a common effect in all birth scenarios, pre- and postnatal pet exposure enriched the abundance of Oscillospira and/or Ruminococcus (P\u2009<\u20090.05) with more than a twofold greater likelihood of high abundance. Among vaginally born infants with maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis exposure, Streptococcaceae were substantially and significantly reduced by pet exposure (P\u2009<\u20090.001, FDRp\u2009=\u20090.03), reflecting an 80% decreased likelihood of high abundance (OR 0.20, 95%CI, 0.06-0.70) for pet exposure during pregnancy alone and a 69% reduced likelihood (OR 0.31, 95%CI, 0.16-0.58) for exposure in the pre- and postnatal time periods. All of these associations were independent of maternal asthma/allergy status, siblingship, breastfeeding exclusivity and other home characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of pet ownership varies under different birth scenarios; however, in common, exposure to pets increased the abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been negatively associated with childhood atopy and obesity.",

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer&amp;#039;s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease throughout the world. Most of the clinical symptoms of AD appear at a very later stage, therefore, the identification of disease markers is essential which can help proper detection of AD at an earlier stage and slow down its progression. Studies have implicated that epigenetic biomarkers, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and non coding RNA mediated regulation serve crucial roles in several disease progression including AD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to identify the topologically significant AD-related proteins from experimentally validated human protein-protein interaction database, HPRD (interactome) and find out novel epigenetic biomarkers. METHOD: In this computational work, we constructed AD specific diseasome from AD genelist and interactome. Using this diseasome we screened the interactome with the help of novel parameters namely degree band and similarity index and identified AD related proteins. Regulatory network involving AD related proteins, not previously known to be associated with AD was constructed. Several network motifs and epigenetic modification patterns of regulators of these motifs were studied. RESULT: Our study identified computationally predicted 22 epigenetic genes and 11 epigenetic miRs, not previously known to be associated with AD, from the network motifs. Most of these genes and miRs show brain specific expression. Further study on the epigenetic modification patterns of these regulators regarding histone modification, CpG island and lncRNAs strengthened their association in AD. CONCLUSION: Computationally predicted genes and miRs identified in our study might provide insight into new epigenetic AD therapeutic targets.",

Although several mutations in NGLY1 have been identified, the relation between the defected protein and the above described pathologies is yet unknown. We hypothesised that NGLY1 failure to degrade certain proteins may result in their accumulation and overexpression and used a systems biology approach to identify proteins that may be affected by NGLY1 deficiency. Genes that interact with the NGLY1 gene according to BioGRID database of physical and genetic interactions were analysed with STRING Protein-Protein interaction database. Network analysis identified FAF1 (Fas-Associated Factor 1), an apoptosis-potentiating protein, as a possible degradation substrate of NGLY1. Examination of normal tissue microarrays demonstrated that FAF1-to-NGLY1 ratio is maximal (more than 3:1) in skeletal muscle and brain tissues microarrays. This evidence may explain the pathologies in brain and muscle tissues of patients with mutated NGLY1. To test this hypothesis, laboratory studies that will assess if FAF1 protein is overexpressed in tissues of patients with mutated NGLY1 are required.",

We subjected Haemophilus influenzae, (hiGlpG), Escherichia coli GlpG (ecGlpG) and Bacillus subtilis (YqgP) to sedimentation equilibrium analysis in detergent-solubilized dodecylmaltoside (DDM) solution. For hiGlpG and ecGlpG, rhomboids consisting of the core 6 transmembrane domains without and with soluble domains respectively, and YqgP, predicted to have 7 transmembrane domains with larger soluble domains at the termini, the predominant species was dimeric with low amounts of monomer and tetramers observed. To examine the effect of the membrane domain alone on oligomeric state of rhomboid, hiGlpG, the simplest form from the rhomboid class of intramembrane proteases representing the canonical rhomboid core of six transmembrane domains, was studied further. Using gel filtration and crosslinking we demonstrate that hiGlpG is dimeric and functional in DDM detergent solution. More importantly co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that the dimer is present in the lipid bilayer suggesting a physiological dimer. Overall these results indicate that rhomboids form oligomers which are facilitated by the membrane domain. For hiGlpG we have shown that these oligomers exist in the lipid bilayer.

We demonstrate that PARL-mediated cleavage during mitochondrial import partitions STARD7 to the cytosol and the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Negatively charged amino acids in STARD7 serve as a sorting signal allowing mitochondrial release of mature STARD7 upon cleavage by PARL On the other hand, membrane insertion of STARD7 mediated by the TIM23 complex promotes mitochondrial localization of mature STARD7.

In two phase\u00a0III non-inferiority trials (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2) in treatment-experienced patients already virologically suppressed on their current antiretroviral (ART) regimen, switching to once-daily dolutegravir plus rilpivirine maintained virological suppression over 48\u00a0weeks.

Methods SLE patients with AAC hospitalized in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) from January 2001 to September 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Their medical records were systematically reviewed. The diagnosis of AAC was based on clinical manifestations and confirmed by radiologic findings including a distended gallbladder with thickened wall, pericholecystic fluid and absence of gallstones. Results Among the 8411 hospitalized SLE patients in PUMCH, 13 (0.15%) were identified to have SLE-AAC. Eleven (84.6%) of them were female, with a mean age of 30.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6 years. AAC was the initial manifestation of SLE in four (30.8%) cases. Eleven (84.6%) patients complained of fever and abdominal pain, four (30.8%) had positive Murphy's sign and six (46.2%) had elevated liver enzymes. The median SLE Disease Activity Index was 8.0 (range 0-20.0) at the time of AAC.

BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with wide clinical features ranging from cutaneous manifestations to systemic disease. Skin is one of the most commonly affected organs in SLE. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is any correlation between discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and the severity of SLE. METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, 60 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed SLE were enrolled. Skin biopsy was performed to establish the diagnosis of DLE. Disease activity was determined by the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). A SLEDAI-2K score \u2265 10 was considered active and severe disease. RESULTS: Eleven SLE patients (9 females and 2 males) had DLE (18.3%) and 49 patients (46 females and 3 males) had SLE without DLE (81.7%). The mean age of patients with DLE was 30.18 \u00b1 11.07 years and in patients without it was 28.4 \u00b1 10.26 years (p \u200a=\u200a .6). Three of 11 patients with DLE (27.3%) and 14 of 49 patients without DLE (28.6%) had a SLEDAI-2K score \u2265 10 (p \u200a=\u200a 1). CONCLUSION: The presence of DLE in our patients with SLE was not associated with less severe disease.",

Any part of the heart can be affected, including the pericardium, myocardium, coronary arteries, valves, and the conduction system. In addition to pericarditis and myocarditis, a high incidence of CAD has become increasingly recognized as a cause of mortality, especially in older adult patients and those with long-standing SLE. Many unanswered questions remain in terms of understanding the pathogenesis of cardiac manifestations of SLE. It is not currently possible to predict the patients who are at greatest risk for the various types of cardiac involvement. However, with the rapid advancement of basic science and translational research approaches, it is now becoming easier to identify specific mutations associated with SLE. A better understanding of these genetic factors may eventually allow clinicians to categorize and predict the patients who are at risk for specific cardiac manifestations of SLE.",

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), brain and kidney are the most frequently affected organs. Measurements of cerebral blood flow and metabolism by means of positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPET) can contribute to the diagnostic assessment of the involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in SLE. Functional imaging has been proven to be more sensitive than morphological imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography). In this report, we present the case of a 70-year-old female patient, suffering from SLE without symptoms of CNS involvement. In addition to a SPET study using technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) and a PET scan with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (18FDG), a SPET study after acetazolamide injection was performed in order to assess the cerebral perfusion reserve. While the PET scan showed no major abnormalities, and the baseline SPET study revealed only minor changes, the acetazolamide-enhanced SPET study revealed a marked reduction of the cortical perfusion reserve, particularly in both frontal lobes. It is concluded that \"preclinical\" CNS involvement, mainly caused by pathological mechanisms involving the cerebral blood vessels, can be considered to exist in this patient with SLE.",

HIC-1 is a gene that is hypermethylated in cancer, and commonly downregulated in human breast cancer. However, the precise mechanisms and molecular pathways regulated by HIC-1 remain unclear. We assessed HIC-1 expression on a tissue microarray containing 80 cases of breast cancer. We also analyzed its biological function by restoring HIC-1 expression using 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine (5-CdR) and small-activating RNAs for the reversal of HIC-1 tumor suppressive effects on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. An Agilent Q44h global expressing microarray was probed after restoring the expression of HIC-1. Data demonstrated that HIC-1 expression was reduced significantly in breast cancer tissues. HIC-1 immunohistochemistry resulted in mean staining scores in cancer tissue and normal ductal epithelia of 3.54 and 8.2, respectively (p<0.01). 5-CdR partially reversed HIC-1 expression, and modulated cell growth and apoptosis. dsHIC1-2998, an saRNA, showed activating efficacy in breast cancer cells. A group of differentially expressed genes were characterized by cDNA microarray. Upon saRNA treatment, genes upregulated included those involved in immune activation, cell cycle interference, the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, and cell differentiation. Downregulated genes included oncogenes and those that play roles in cell invasion, cell growth, and cell division. Our findings may provide valuable resources not only for gene functional studies, but also for potential clinical applications to develop novel drug targets.",

          "context": "Treatment of Liver Cancer by C/EBPA saRNA. The prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor and has not improved in over two decades. Most patients with advanced HCC who are not eligible for surgery have limited treatment options due to poor liver function or large, unresectable tumors. Although sorafenib is the standard-of-care treatment for these patients, only a small number respond. For the remaining, the outlook remains bleak. A better approach to target \"undruggable\" molecular pathways that reverse HCC is therefore urgently needed. Small activating RNAs (saRNAs) may provide a novel strategy to activate expression of genes that become dysregulated in chronic disease. The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u03b1), a critical regulator of hepatocyte function, is suppressed in many advanced liver diseases. By using an saRNA to activate C/EBP\u03b1, we can exploit the cell's own transcription machinery to enhance gene expression without relying on exogenous vectors that have been the backbone of gene therapy. saRNAs do not integrate into the host genome and can be modified to avoid immune stimulation. In preclinical models of liver disease, treatment with C/EBP\u03b1 saRNA has shown reduction in tumor volume and improvement in serum markers of essential liver function such as albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT). This saRNA that activates C/EBP\u03b1 for advanced HCC is the first saRNA therapy to have entered a human clinical trial. The hope is that this new tool will help break the dismal 20-year trend and provide a more positive prognosis for patients with severe liver disease.",

We present a novel method for treating bladder cancer with intravesically delivered small activating RNA (saRNA) in an orthotopic xenograft mouse bladder tumor model. The mouse model is established by urethral catheterization under inhaled general anesthetic. Chemical burn is then introduced to the bladder mucosa using intravesical silver nitrate solution to disrupt the bladder glycosaminoglycan layer and allows cells to attach. Following several washes with sterile water, human bladder cancer KU-7-luc2-GFP cells are instilled through the catheter into the bladder to dwell for 2 hours. Subsequent growth of bladder tumors is confirmed and monitored by in vivo bladder ultrasound and bioluminescent imaging. The tumors are then treated intravesically with saRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Tumor growth is monitored with ultrasound and bioluminescence. All steps of this procedure are demonstrated in the accompanying video.",
