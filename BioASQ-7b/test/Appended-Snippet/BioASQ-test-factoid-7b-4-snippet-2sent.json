In large phase III trials, oral apixaban was noninferior to subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium overlapped with and followed by oral warfarin (enoxaparin/warfarin) in the treatment of adults with acute VTE over 6\u00a0months with regard to the incidence of recurrent VTE or VTE-related death (AMPLIFY), and was significantly more effective than placebo in the prevention of recurrent VTE or all-cause mortality over 12\u00a0months in patients who had completed 6-12\u00a0months' anticoagulation treatment for VTE (AMPLIFY-EXT).

Telomerecat is designed to be agnostic to the number of telomeres present, making it suited for the purpose of estimating telomere length in cancer studies. Telomerecat also accounts for interstitial telomeric reads and presents a novel approach to dealing with sequencing errors. We show that Telomerecat performs well at telomere length estimation when compared to leading experimental and computational methods. Furthermore, we show that it detects expected patterns in longitudinal data, repeated measurements, and cross-species comparisons. We also apply the method to a cancer cell data, uncovering an interesting relationship with the underlying telomerase genotype."

Targeted deletion of two SNARE-encoding genes in V. dahliae, VdSec22 and VdSso1, significantly reduced virulence of both mutants on cotton, relative to the wild-type Vd991 strain. Comparative analyses of the secreted protein content (exoproteome) revealed that many enzymes involved in carbohydrate hydrolysis were regulated by VdSec22 or VdSso1. Consistent with a role of these enzymes in plant cell-wall degradation, pectin, cellulose, and xylan utilization were reduced in the VdSec22 or VdSso1 mutant strains along with a loss of exoproteome cytotoxic activity on cotton leaves. Comparisons with a pathogenicity-related exoproteome revealed that several known virulence factors were not regulated by VdSec22 or VdSso1, but some of the proteins regulated by VdSec22 or VdSso1 displayed different characteristics, including the lack of a typical signal peptide, suggesting that V. dahliae employs more than one secretory route to transport proteins to extracellular sites during infection."

Our objective was to determine the genetic cause of POI in a consanguineous Lebanese family with two affected sisters presenting with primary amenorrhoea and an absence of any pubertal development. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis was performed. Whole-exome sequencing was done on the proband. Linkage analysis identified a locus on chromosome 7 where exome sequencing successfully identified a homozygous two base pair duplication (c.1947_48dupCT), leading to a truncated protein p.(Y650Sfs*22) in the STAG3 gene, confirming it as the cause of POI in this family. Exome sequencing combined with linkage analyses offers a powerful tool to efficiently find novel genetic causes of rare, heterogeneous disorders, even in small single families. This is only the second report of a STAG3 variant; the first STAG3 variant was recently described in a phenotypically similar family with extreme POI. Identification of an additional family highlights the importance of STAG3 in POI pathogenesis and suggests it should be evaluated in families affected with POI."

With regard to recent developments in utilizing the CRISPR-Cpf1 system in genome editing of various organisms, it can be concluded with confidence that this system is a reliable molecular toolbox of genome editing approaches."

First described in 1983, Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that leads to a spectrum of hypogonadal symptoms in adolescence. The responsible gene, DCAF17 located on chromosome 2q31.1, was discovered in 2008 and to date nine mutations have been reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to review WSS descriptively in the light of new case reports with focus on endocrine features. Phenotypic description of three patients (two females, one male) with WSS followed in the Endocrinology Department of the University Hospital of Nancy, France, and exhaustive review of the literature using the PUBMED database were performed."

This is supplemented by the mechanisms of drug action at these important anticonvulsant targets for classical and clinically relevant compounds (e.g. phenytoin, ethosuximide) as well as some important second generation drugs (e.g. gabapentin, levetiracetam) and novel experimental agents (e.g. retigabine, losigamone, safinamide).

On May 23, 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a treatment for cancer patients with positive microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) markers or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) markers. This approach is the first approved tumor treatment using a common biomarker rather than specified tumor locations in the body. FDA previously approved Keytruda for treatment of several types of malignancies, such as metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma, all of which carry positive programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 biomarkers. Therefore, indications of Keytruda significantly expanded. Several types of malignancies are disclosed by MSI-H status due to dMMR and characterized by increased neoantigen load, which elicits intense host immune response in tumor microenvironment, including portions of colorectal and gastric carcinomas. Currently, biomarker-based patient selection remains a challenge. Pathologists play important roles in evaluating histology and biomarker results and establishing detection methods. Taking gastric cancer as an example, its molecular classification is built on genome abnormalities, but it lacks acceptable clinical characteristics. Pathologists are expected to act as \"genetic interpreters\" or \"genetic translators\" and build a link between molecular subtypes with tumor histological features. Subsequently, by using their findings, oncologists will carry out targeted therapy based on molecular classification."
