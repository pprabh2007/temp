Virulent strain 2336 mutants lacking the entire ibpA gene or both DR1 and DR2 were not toxic to the monocytes but still survived within the monocytes for at least 72 h. Monitoring of intracellular trafficking of H. somni with monoclonal antibodies to phagosomal markers indicated that the early phagosomal marker early endosome antigen 1 colocalized with all isolates tested, but only strains that could survive intracellularly did not colocalize with the late lysosomal marker lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 and prevented the acidification of phagosomes. These results indicated that virulent isolates of H. somni were capable of surviving within phagocytic cells through interference in phagosome-lysosome maturation. Therefore, H. somni may be considered a permissive intracellular pathogen."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis, subverts this host defense mechanism by arresting maturation of the phagosome. The ability of Mtb to arrest its delivery to the lysosome can be demonstrated by the prolonged co-localization of bacteria containing phagosomes/vacuole with early phagosomal markers [such as, Ras-related proteins in the brain 5 (Rab5) and Transferrin receptor (TfR)], and a failure to acquire late phagosomal and lysosomal markers (such as Rab7 and LAMP1) (Deretic and Fratti, 1999, Mehra et al., 2013). Here, a protocol is outlined for infection of macrophages with mycobacterial species like pathogenic Mtb, vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis- bacillus Calmatte- Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) and rapidly dividing non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmeg), followed by indirect-immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize host vacuolar markers."

Vacuoles containing B. cenocepacia strain J2315, an isolate of the transmissible ET12 clone, recruited Rab5 and synthesized phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, indicating progression to the early phagosomal stage. Despite the fact that the B. cenocepacia-containing vacuoles rarely fused with lysosomes, they could nevertheless acquire the late phagosomal markers CD63 and Rab7. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and use of a probe that detects Rab7-guanosine triphosphate indicated that activation of Rab7 was impaired by B. cenocepacia, accounting at least in part for the inability of the vacuole to merge with lysosomes. The Rab7 defect was not due to excessive cholesterol accumulation and was confined to the infected vacuoles."

Lack of STAMP2 in adipocytes results in aberrant inflammatory responses to both nutrients and acute inflammatory stimuli.

LEM-3 locally processes chromatin bridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombination intermediates, or the perturbance of chromosome structure. Proper LEM-3 midbody localization and function is regulated by AIR-2/Aurora B kinase.

However, LEM-3 foci do not colocalize with ZHP-3, a marker that congresses into CO designated sites. In addition, neither CO frequency nor distribution is altered in lem-3 single mutants or in combination with mus-81 or slx-4 mutations. Finally, we found persistent chromatin bridges during meiotic divisions in lem-3; slx-4 double mutants.

An increase in AKT and FAK phosphorylation, associated with increased proliferation and invasiveness, paralleled by the acquisition of mesenchymal markers, and overexpression of the oncomir miR-21 were observed in SKMES-1-derived cell clones with a stable reduction of PTEN.

Methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles.

The patient was not a carrier of HLA-B5701, and abacavir hypersensitivity was unlikely. We believe this is the first report of severe dolutegravir-related hepatotoxicity resulting in sub-acute liver failure and transplantation and highlights a potential need for closer monitoring after drug initiation."

We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8. Our results demonstrate that new associations at common variants continue to identify genes relevant to therapeutic target identification and prioritization."

Gene-level analyses indicate three functional candidates: DNMT3A, PRKCD, and C1QTNF4. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (P = 0.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.0033). We further characterise the TNF-dependent functions of the third candidate gene C1QTNF4 on NF-\u03baB activation and apoptosis, which are inhibited by the p.His198Gln DNM. Our results identify three novel genes in SLE susceptibility and support extreme-phenotype sampling and DNM gene discovery to aid the search for core disease genes implicated through rare variation."
