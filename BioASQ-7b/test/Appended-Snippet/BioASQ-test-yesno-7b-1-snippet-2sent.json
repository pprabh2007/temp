In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. SUMMARY: PACIFIC trial results are expected to definitely establish durvalumab as standard consolidation strategy in LA-NSCLC."

Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main problem with checkpoint blockers is that only a fraction of patients respond to the therapy. Insufficient immune activation is considered as one of the main reason for low response rates and combination of checkpoint blockers has been proposed to increase the response rates."

Very little is known about factors that influence variation in the milk microbiome among women and populations, although time postpartum, delivery mode, and maternal factors such as diet and antibiotic use might be important. The origins of the bacteria in milk are thought to include the maternal gastrointestinal tract (via an entero-mammary pathway) and through bacterial exposure of the breast during nursing. Currently, almost nothing is known about whether variation in microbe consumption by the infant via human milk and that of the mammary gland, itself, impacts short-term and/or long-term infant and maternal health although several studies suggest this is likely. We urge the clinical and public health communities to be patient, however, in order to allow human milk and lactation researchers to first understand what constitutes 'normal' in terms of the milk microbiome (as well as factors that impact microbial community structure) prior to jumping the gun to investigate if and how this important source of microbes impacts maternal and infant health."

Several studies provide support for the view that the enteric microbiome influences behavior through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Moreover, recent findings are suggestive of the possibility that dysregulation of the enteric microbiota (i.e., dysbiosis) and associated bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium may be involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders, particularly depression. The current article reviews preliminary evidence linking the enteric microbiota and its metabolites to psychiatric illness, along with separate lines of empirical inquiry on the potential involvement of psychosocial stressors, proinflammatory cytokines and neuroinflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and vagal nerve activation, respectively, in this relationship. Finally, and drawing on these independent lines of research, an integrative conceptual model is proposed in which stress-induced enteric dysbiosis and intestinal permeability confer risk for negative mental health outcomes through immunoregulatory, endocrinal, and neural pathways."

Direct binding of domain 3 (D3) of uPAR to LRP is required for clearance of uPA-PAI-1-occupied uPAR because internalization is blocked by incubation with recombinant D3. Moreover, uPA-dependent plasmin generation and the ability of HT1080 cells to migrate through Matrigel-coated invasion chambers are also inhibited in the presence of D3. These results demonstrate that GPI-anchored uPAR is endocytosed by piggybacking on LRP and that direct binding of occupied uPAR to LRP is essential for internalization of occupied uPAR, regeneration of unoccupied uPAR, plasmin generation, and invasion and migration through extracellular matrix."

Circularization of genomic DNA is observed across eukaryotic species, in a range of different cell types, and from all parts of the genome. A recent study on circular DNAs in yeast found that transposable element sequence residing in circular structures mostly corresponded to full-length transposable elements. Transposable elements are mobile genetic elements scattered across eukaryotic genomes. Different classes of transposable elements move either through a copy-and-paste or a cut-and-paste."

We previously designed a chlorotoxin peptide fused to human IgG Fc region without hinge sequence (M-CTX-Fc), which exhibited a stronger growth inhibitory effect on the glioblastoma cell line A172 than an original chlorotoxin peptide. Combining these results together, we designed M-CTX-Fc conjugated liposomes encapsulating doxorubicin and used U251MG-P1 cells as the target model in this study. The liposome modified with M-CTX-Fc was designed with a diameter of approximately 100-150 nm and showed high encapsulation efficiency, adequate loading capacity of anticancer drug, enhanced antitumor effects demonstrating increasing uptake into the cells in vitro; M-CTX-Fc-L-Dox shows great promise in its ability to suppress tumor growth in vivo and it could serve as a template for targeted delivery of other therapeutics."

Osteosarcoma represents the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents, which shows severe resistance toward standard chemotherapy because of high invasive capacity and growing incidence. Selenocysteine (SeC) is a naturally available Se-containing amino acid that displays splendid anticancer activities against several human tumors. However, little information about SeC-induced growth inhibition against human osteosarcoma is available. Herein, the anticancer efficiency and underlying mechanism of SeC against human osteosarcoma were evaluated in vitro and in vivo."

The purpose of this article is to discuss important clinical and pathophysiologic differences between relapsing and progressive forms of MS, review previous notable trials of drugs in progressive MS, examine current literature regarding recent and promising progressive MS treatments, and discuss future considerations for progressive MS therapeutics and management. Specifically, the current evidence regarding treatment of progressive MS with ocrelizumab, simvastatin, ibudilast, alpha-lipoic acid, high-dose biotin, siponimod, and cell-based therapies are discussed."

Management of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the main challenges of the new century. Based on our knowledge of pathophysiology, three therapeutic strategies are proposed: anti-inflammatory (ocrelizumab, siponimod\u2026); remyelinating (opicinumab); and neuroprotective (high-dose biotin, ibudilast, simvastatin\u2026). Nevertheless, despite recent promising positive clinical trials, new methodological approaches for therapeutic protocols with adaptable outcomes to assess progression are still needed."
