Preferential integration points in the rye genome exist, because the new insertions seem to be located, in all studied cases, in the same genome positions. We assume that RYS1 became active in rye very recently, as different plants from in vivo-growing cultivars showed that these elements were present or absent in the same genomic position in which the in vitro-activated element was found. This high rate of modification in these particular loci, both in the in vivo and in vitro populations, could indicate that probably the mechanisms promoting genetic variability in nature are the same that induce variation in vitro, and the modifications induced by somaclonal variation could be already present in vivo populations."

However, a similar approach did not reveal any structural pattern of DNA that could be used to predict favored integration sites for other transposons as well as retroviruses and lentiviruses due to a limitation of available data sets. Nonetheless, ProTIS has the utility for predicting likely SB transposon integration sites in investigator-selected regions of genomes and our general strategy may be useful for other mobile elements once a sufficiently high density of sites in a single region are obtained. ProTIS analysis can be useful for functional genomic, gene transfer and human gene therapy applications using the SB system."

Remarkably, Bouncer not only is required for sperm-egg interaction but is also sufficient to allow cross-species fertilization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged more than 200 million years ago.

A number of genes downregulated upon dual Esrrb/Sox2 knockdown (e.g., Klf4, Klf5, Jam2, Pecam1) are similarly downregulated in the ESC to EpiSC transition and contain the esrrb-sox motif.

The United Nations Millennium Development Goal of reversing the global spread of tuberculosis by 2015 has been offset by the rampant re-emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, in particular fluoroquinolone-resistant multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. After decades of quiescence in the development of antituberculosis medications, bedaquiline and delamanid have been conditionally approved for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis, while several other novel compounds (AZD5847, PA-824, SQ109 and sutezolid) have been evaluated in phase II clinical trials. Before novel drugs can find their place in the battle against drug-resistant tuberculosis, linezolid has been compassionately used with success in the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. This review largely discusses six novel drugs that have been evaluated in phase II and III clinical trials, with focus on the clinical evidence for efficacy and safety, potential drug interactions, and prospect for using multiple novel drugs in new regimens."

Various molecules, such as derivatives of fluoroquinolones (e.g. gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and DC-159a), rifamycins (rifapentine), oxazolidinones (linezolid, sutezolid/PNU-100480), diarylquinolines (TMC207/bedaquiline), antifungal azoles, pyrrole (LL3858), nitroimidazopyran (PA824), nitroimidazole (OPC67683, TBA-354), diamine (SQ109) and benzothiazinone (BTZ043) are being developed in an attempt to combat the disease. This review presents a general introduction to the current status of the disease, the biology of the pathogen as well as the state of drug development against tuberculosis (TB) with emphasis on the major problems and bottlenecks associated with the same. Starting from the first drug against TB, the review discusses the entire history and the course of development of the drugs which are available today in the market as well as those which are under various phases of clinical and pre-clinical trials along with their mechanism of action."
