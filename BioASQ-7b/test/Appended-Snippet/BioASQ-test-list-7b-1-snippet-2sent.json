While the knowledge concerning the role of the immune system in many internal disorders has grown rapidly in recent years, there are few methods to assess immune system activation in clinical practice. Measurement of urine neopterin, product of a metabolic pathway controlled by interferon-gamma, has been found useful in many clinical conditions. The present study concerns neopterin excretion in 157 patients with different internal disorders. As expected, we found an increase in urine neopterin in patients with malignant tumors, autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus or inflammatory bowel disease, and infections."

Numerous activities of senescent cells depend on the aptitude of these cells to secrete myriads of bioactive molecules, a behavior termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP supports cell-autonomous functions like the senescence-associated growth arrest, and mediates paracrine interactions between senescent cells and their surrounding microenvironment. The biological functions and the regulation of the SASP are beginning to emerge, and current SASP assessment techniques include the analysis of SASP factors at the mRNA level, the direct measurement of factors inside or outside the cell (i.e., secreted), and the detection of SASP-provoked cellular responses. Here, we focus on a simple approach to collect SASP-conditioned media in order to directly measure secreted SASP factors using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."
