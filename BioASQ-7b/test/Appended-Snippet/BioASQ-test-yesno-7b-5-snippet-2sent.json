Non-allelic homologous recombination between chromosome-specific LCRs is the most common mechanism leading to recurrent microdeletions and duplications. To look for locus-specific differences, we have used microsatellites to determine the parental and chromosomal origins of a large series of patients with de novo deletions of chromosome 7q11.23 (Williams syndrome), 15q11-q13 (Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome) and 22q11 (Di George syndrome) and duplications of 15q11-q13. Overall the majority of rearrangements were interchromosomal, so arising from unequal meiotic exchange, and there were approximately equal numbers of maternal and paternal deletions. Duplications and deletions of 15q11-q13 appear to be reciprocal products that arise by the same mechanisms."

Functional roles of exosomes were tested in migration and invasion tests. Then we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of acid versus control exosomes to elucidate a specific signature involved in melanoma progression."

To follow the CT intracellular route towards exosome secretion, we used a novel strategy for generating metabolically-labeled fluorescent exosomes that can be counted by flow cytometry assay (FACS) and characterized. Our results clearly show the association of CT with exosomes, together with the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) molecules, proteins required for translocation of CTA across the ER membrane into the cytoplasm. Confocal microscopy showed direct internalization of CT containing fluorescent exo into CHO cells coupled with morphological changes in the recipient cells that are characteristic of CT action."

The discovery of nuclear actin opened new perspective on the field, suggesting that the nuclear activities of actin reflect the functions of primordial actin-like proteins. In this paper, we review the recent literature to explore the evolutionary origin of nuclear actin. We conclude that both ancient and eukaryotic features of the actin world can be detected in the nucleus today, which supports the idea that the cytoskeleton attained significant eukaryotic innovations before the tandem evolution of the cytoskeleton and nucleus occurred."

In order to study early signaling events activated by oncogenic KRAS in the pancreas, we recently developed a novel model system based on murine primary pancreatic epithelial cells enabling the time-specific expression of mutant Kras from its endogenous promoter. Here, we discuss our findings of a Kras-induced autocrine EGFR loop, how this loop is integrated by the MYC oncogene, and point to possible translational implications."

However, the molecular mechanism underlying regulation of ZO-1 expression by GM-CSF is unclear. Herein, we found that the erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor ERG cooperated with the proto-oncogene protein c-MYC in regulation of ZO-1 transcription in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). The ERG expression was suppressed by miR-96 which was increased by GM-CSF through the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Inhibition of miR-96 prevented ZO-1 down-regulation induced by GM-CSF both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo."

Numerous anti-cancer agents inhibit cell cycle progression via a p53-dependent mechanism; however, other genes such as the proto-oncogene c-Myc are promising targets for anticancer therapy. In the present study, we provide evidence that ascochlorin, an isoprenoid antibiotic, is a non-toxic anti-cancer agent that induces G1 cell cycle arrest and p21 expression by downregulating of c-Myc protein expression. Ascochlorin promoted the G1 arrest, upregulated p53 and p21 , and downregulated c-Myc in HCT116 cells. In p53-deficient cells, ascochlorin enhanced the expression of G1 arrest-related genes except p53."

The results show\u00a0that vacuolated cells treated with these compounds release exosomes with morphologies similar to untreated controls. However, both compounds trigger multi-fold increases in release of exosome marker proteins (e.g., CD63, Alix) in exosome fractions collected from equivalent numbers of cells. Despite the marked increase in exosome production, the profiles of selected miRNA cargoes carried by the exosomes were generally similar in cells treated with the compounds. Insofar as MOPIPP and vacuolin-1 seem able to increase the overall yield of exosomes from cultured cells, they might be useful for efforts to develop exosome-based therapeutics."

In this study, Exosomes were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of SCI and normal, and incubated neuron in vitro respectively to research its biological function in cell proliferation. The results demonstrated these exosomes all expressed CD9, CD63, CD81, Alix and Tsg101; however, only exosomes derived from cerebrospinal fluid of SCI could promote proliferation of neuron via ERK signaling pathway, and decrease cell apoptosis. Exosomes contain cytosolic content, including proteins, mRNAs and non-cording RNAs, and play a role in important biological function. Our research showed exosomes derived from cerebrospinal fluid of SCI, they can influence neuron cell proliferation in vitro, we did not observe these characters in exosome derived from normal cerebrospinal fluid."
