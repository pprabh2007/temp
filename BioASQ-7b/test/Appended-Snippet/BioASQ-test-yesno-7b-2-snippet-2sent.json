Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins."

In the cytoplasm, TIAM1 localizes to the destruction complex and promotes TAZ degradation by enhancing its interaction with \u03b2TrCP. Nuclear TIAM1 suppresses TAZ/YAP interaction with TEADs, inhibiting expression of TAZ/YAP target genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and invasion, and consequently suppresses CRC cell migration and invasion. Importantly, high nuclear TIAM1 in clinical specimens associates with increased CRC patient survival. Together, our findings suggest that in CRC TIAM1 suppresses tumor progression by regulating YAP/TAZ activity."

Methylation patterns of MSCs are distinct from those of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and multipotent hESC-derived mesenchymal cells (MCs). Moreover, in vitro MSC differentiation does not affect lineage-specific promoter methylation states, arguing that these methylation patterns in differentiated cells are already established at the progenitor stage.

In this review, we summarize the most important recent developments in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In terms of disease-modifying treatment options, several drugs such as dexpramipexole, pioglitazone, lithium, and many others have been tested in large multicenter trials, albeit with disappointing results. Therefore, riluzole remains the only directly disease-modifying drug. In addition, we discuss antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a new and potentially causal treatment option."

In 1996, the relatively frequent occurrence of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) activating mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was first recognized. Several years later, midostaurin was discovered to be a potent inhibitor of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase and to have activity against mutant forms of KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase, which drive advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM)."

Besides that, we also find the highly unchanged genes are enriched in some other pathways, such as the nutrient-sensitive signaling pathway. To facilitate the investigation of unique UCSs, the UCSC Genome Browser was utilized to visualize the chromosomal position and related annotations of UCSs in S.cerevisiae genome."
