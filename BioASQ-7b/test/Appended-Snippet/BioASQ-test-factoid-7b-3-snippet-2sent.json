SD causes progressive neurodegeneration and changes in white matter in human infants. An animal model of SD has been established, Hexb-deficient (Hexb) mice, which shows abnormalities resembling the severe phenotype found in human infants. Previously, we reported that the activation state of microglia caused astrogliosis in the early stage of Hexb mouse development."

We show that when applied to cell-derived giant plasma membrane vesicles, a variant of CTxB containing only a single functional GM1 binding site exhibits significantly reduced partitioning to the ordered phase compared to wild-type CTxB with five binding sites.

Periodic leaf-movement of legumes is called nyctinasty and has been known since the age of Alexander the Great. We found that nyctinasty is controlled by a periodic change of the internal concentration of leaf-opening and leaf-closing substances in the plant body. Now, we have developed novel fluorescent probes (1) based on the structure of cis-p-coumaroylagmatine (3), which was isolated as a leaf-opening substance of Albizzia juribrissin Durazz. Binding experiments using probe 1 showed that Albizza plants have receptors for a leaf-opening substance in their motor cells."

The approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and mammalian species, allowing nonhuman sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground-truth data. We further show that DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, including deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics and Ion Ampliseq exomes, highlighting the benefits of using more automated and generalizable techniques for variant calling."

These regulatory approvals marked an important milestone that a cancer treatment may be approved based on a common biomarker rather than the anatomic location in the body where the tumor originated, and therefore established a precedent for tumor type-agnostic therapy. In the 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meeting, larotrectinib (LOXO-101), Loxooncology's oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), demonstrated unprecedented efficacy on unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK)-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients. Both the anti-PD-1 mAbs and the TRK-targeting therapies share some basic features: (a) biomarker-based, well-defined rare patient population; (b) exceptionally high clinical efficacy, e.g., near 40% overall response rate (ORR) for pembrolizumab across 15 tumor types with MSI-H/dMMR and 75% ORR for larotrectinib across more than 12 tumor types with NTRK-fusion proteins; (c) durable responses lasting at least 6\u00a0months with complete responses observed; and (d) parallel development in adult and pediatric populations.

In the current version, the database collected \u223c0.8 million SNVs accumulated in \u223c600 single normal cells (579 human cells and 39 mouse cells). The database interface supports the user-friendly capability of browsing and searching the SNVs and their annotation information. DSMNC, which serves as a timely and valuable collection of somatic mutations in individual normal cells, has made it possible to analyze the burdens and signatures of somatic mutations in various types of heterogeneous normal cells. Therefore, DSMNC will significantly improve our understanding of the characteristics of somatic mutations in normal cells."
